**UDX external adapters** expand the capability of UNIDEX consoles to handle various types of signals and devices.

They connect easily using RJ45-RJ45 cables. Each UDX adapter requires connection to a UNIDEX input. Some UDX models also use console outputs.

All UNIDEX adapter functions are **controlled from the console**.

Available modules are:

## Mounting UDX Boxes

**RJ45** connections are very reliable but require certain conditions to ensure proper installation.

- It is essential that boxes and cables are firmly fixed, preventing any movement at the connector.
- Cables must be installed in **electrical conduit** or **cable ducts**, so they are not loose or subject to mechanical stress.
- UDX boxes must be mounted securely to the wall or under tables.\
  They have **two notches** that allow them to be fastened with screws and easily removed if necessary.
