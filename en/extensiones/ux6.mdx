The UX6 extension adds **physical faders** to control 6 channels on the UNIDEX UX24 console. \
Up to two UX6 modules can be installed, one on each side, to cover all 24 channels of the console.

If you purchased UX6 modules together with UNIDEX UX24, they come factory-ready for assembly.

The procedure to install and configure UX6 expansions [is detailed in this document](http://www.solidyne.dx.com.ar/wordpress-files/DW/doc-guides/UNIDEX_expansion_UX6_ESP.pdf).
