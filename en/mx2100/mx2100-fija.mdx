The console connects to the telephone line through the **RJ11 "Cellular & Phone"** connector using a standard telephone cable.

- Built-in **DTMF** keypad, so no additional telephone is required.
- The **program mix** is sent to the radio station through the line.
- The **return from Studios** is received through the same line and directly mixed into the headphones mix.
