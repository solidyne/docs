## Front Panel

### Power On

Turn on the unit by pressing the **ON** button, whether connected to the charger or running on internal battery.

<Note>
  When the unit is connected via USB to the charger or computer, the charge indicator LED (**CHG**) remains lit even if the console is turned off.\
  Battery life: 16 hours of continuous use.\
  Full charge time: 12 hours.\
  The charging system automatically reduces current when reaching 100%, so it can remain connected indefinitely.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Remember to turn off the console after use to avoid unnecessary battery drain.
</Warning>

## Program Mixer

The program signal (**PGM**) is generated by mixing the following sources: **MIC-1, MIC-2, MIC-3, MIC-4 (built-in), LINE, Bluetooth and USB**.\
Some inputs share controls and their availability depends on how the console is connected.

- The PGM signal is sent to the radio via telephone or computer with Internet.
- It is also present at the **BAL OUT** connector on the rear panel.

**MIC-3/USB Control**

Switches between MIC-3 input or computer connected via USB. When MX2100 is used connected to a computer for Internet transmission, a microphone **must be connected to MIC-3**. In this condition, USB does not enter the PGM mix but is heard in headphones as direct return.

**MIC-4/LIN/Bluetooth Control**

Controls the built-in mic signal, LINE input or Bluetooth device signal, depending on working condition:

- MIC-4 signal available if USB and line input are **NOT** in use.
- LINE signal only available when LIN-4 is connected (overrides MIC-4).
- Bluetooth return available in PGM mix only when console is connected via USB (external computer transmission scenario).

## Headphones

The headphone mix varies according to usage mode:

- **(a) Telephone communication (landline or Bluetooth):**
  - PGM mix: MIC-1, MIC-2, MIC-3 and Line/MIC-4.
  - Direct return from Studio (hybrid or Bluetooth).
  - Ring tone on incoming calls.
- **(b) USB and external computer with one-way streaming:**
  - PGM mix: MIC-1, MIC-2, USB and Bluetooth (used to air another mobile device).
  - USB return (studio return not used due to streaming delay).
- **(c) USB and external computer with real-time link (VoIP):**
  - PGM mix: MIC-1, MIC-2, MIC-3 and LINE.
  - USB return (Studio).
  - Bluetooth return.
  - Hybrid return.

<Note>
  The field reporter hears themselves through the program mix.\
  The studio operator does not need to send their signal back.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Headphone noise floor increases when hybrid is active (**ON-AIR** button pressed).\
  Verify it is not pressed when hybrid is not in use.
</Warning>

## Level Indicator

- Dual LED indicator shows internal compressor action.
- Green LED: low level, no compression.
- Red LED: indicates compression.
- Higher compression results in higher red LED intensity.

<Note>
  Proper working level is achieved when signal peaks occasionally activate the red LED.
</Note>

### Compressor Action

The MX2100 incorporates an **automatic compressor + limiter**, which maintains constant output signal peaks.

- Improves signal-to-noise ratio.
- Ensures uniformity across different transmission channels.
