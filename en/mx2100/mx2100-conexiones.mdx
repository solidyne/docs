## Microphone Inputs

The MX2100 has 3 microphone inputs (MIC-1, MIC-2 and MIC-3) with **TRS 1/4" (6.25 mm)** connectors.

The preamplifiers use _local feedback_ technique, which prevents saturation at high sound pressure levels (for example, a reporter shouting a goal).

### Built-in Microphone

- Built-in electret microphone on the front panel (MIC-4).
- Allows broadcasting even without external microphones.
- Shares level control with line input and Bluetooth return.

<Warning>
  MIC-4 is disabled when using USB connection (to computer or charger) or when line input is connected.\
  The **MIC-4/LIN/Bluetooth** control presents different signals depending on the working scenario (see _Console Operation_).
</Warning>

---

## Line Input

- **LIN-4:** mono line input.
- Accepts direct connection from headphone outputs of portable recorders, mobile phones, laptops, tablets, etc.
- A 1/8" stereo miniplug cable can be used, although the ring (right channel) remains unconnected in the console.
- Shares level control with built-in microphone (MIC-4) and Bluetooth return.

<Warning>
  If connecting stereo equipment, the input will use only one channel. The plug's ring (right channel) remains unconnected in the console.
</Warning>

## Program Output (Bal Out)

- Balanced, monaural output with **TRS 1/8"** connector.
- Signal mix: MIC-1, MIC-2, MIC-3/USB and MIC-4/LINE/Bluetooth.

### Dynamic Processing

The PGM signal goes through a dynamic range compressor designed for human voice:

- Controls peaks and prevents level differences.
- Free from distortion and without background noise increase.
- Compression indication through two front LEDs.

This system allows conducting interviews with consistent levels, without requiring an audio operator.

The PGM output can be used to:

- Connect to portable digital recorders to obtain quality recordings.
- Send signal to Studios via VHF/UHF radio link in high quality (30-15,000 Hz).

## Headphone Outputs

- Internal signal distributor for headphones.
- 3 outputs with 3.5mm minijack connectors.
- The mix sent to headphones depends on connection mode and working scenario (see _Console Operation_).

---

## USB Audio

The **MX2100** console was designed to simplify connection with laptops, enabling Internet streaming broadcasts.

- The **USB** connection handles both **sends** and **returns** of signal with Studios.
- Uses a standard **mini-USB to USB-A male** cable.

### Automatic Operating System Detection

When connecting the MX2100 to a computer with **Windows 7/8/10**, **Linux** or **OS-X**:

- The operating system detects the console and automatically installs the necessary drivers.
- No additional drivers required.

<Info>
  In Windows, the USB device is automatically configured as the **default device**.
</Info>

### Detected Devices

The console identifies as:

- **USB playback device (stereo out):** computer sends audio to MX2100.
- **USB recording device (stereo in):** computer receives audio from MX2100.

## USB Power

- Internal rechargeable Ni-Cd battery.
- Runtime: 16 hours of continuous use thanks to CMOS technology.
- Included automatic multi-voltage USB external charger (100-240 VAC).
- Connection via USB-A to mini-USB cable.

### Charging Time and Method

- Time for full charge: ~12 hours.
- Above that value, charging current decreases and it can remain connected without risk.
- Red LED (CHG) indicates charging in progress.
- LED remains on while unit is connected to charger, even when turned off.
- Also charges when connected via USB to a computer.
