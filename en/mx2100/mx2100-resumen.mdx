The Solidyne MX2100 portable mini-console was designed to provide a cost-effective professional solution for remote broadcasting based on cellular telephony and Internet.

## Operating Features

### Making the Most of Mobile Phones

With the MX2100, direct handling of the mobile phone is no longer necessary. You can use quality dynamic microphones and use the phone solely as a transmitter to establish connection with the radio station.

The phone links to the console **via Bluetooth**.

<Note>
  Bluetooth wireless technology does not require devices to be in line of sight, but the maximum safe distance is 3 meters (absolute maximum: 10 meters). The connection may experience interference from walls or other electronic equipment.
</Note>

### Low Power Consumption for Extended Operation

The console uses ultra-low power CMOS amplifiers.

- Power consumption: less than 0.1 W
- Battery life: over 16 hours of continuous operation
- Intermittent use: 20 to 25 hours

## Connectivity

- USB Input/Output for streaming transmission
- Bluetooth link with mobile phone (to Studio or remote journalist)
