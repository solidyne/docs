Communication is established from the phone connected to the console, either landline or mobile.\
The operation for both cases is described below.


### Mobile Phone

- **Via Bluetooth:**
  1. From the mobile phone, call the radio station.
  2. Once communication is established, use the microphones and headphones connected to the MX2100 to talk with Studios.
  3. If the radio station calls the journalist, the **ring** is heard in headphones and the call signal on the mobile.
  4. The call can be answered from the mobile phone itself or by briefly pressing **# 9** on the console.
- **Via hands-free cable (deprecated):**
  1. Make the call from the mobile phone.
  2. Once established, press the **PHONE** button on the console.
  3. Connect the "hands-free" cable (already connected to the **Cellular & Phone** input of the MX2100) to the mobile connector.
  4. From this point on, dialogue is conducted using the console's microphones and headphones.

<Note>
  To end communication from a mobile phone, hang up and disconnect using the mobile keypad (refer to phone manual).

- The console transmits to Studios using a **Bluetooth-paired mobile phone**.
- A **landline** can be connected as transmission backup.
- The Studios return feed enters via Bluetooth directly into the **headphone mix**.
- The mix of up to **three microphones** and **one line input** (which allows connecting, for example, a portable recorder) is sent on air.

<Warning>
  Connecting the line input **disables the internal microphone (MIC-4)**.
