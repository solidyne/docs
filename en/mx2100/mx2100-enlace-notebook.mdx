## Case 1: Real-time Remote Broadcasting

### About Broadcasting

- Communication with the radio station is established from a **laptop connected via USB** to the MX2100.
- Alternatively, a **tablet or smartphone connected via Bluetooth** can be used.
- The mobile device uses a communications application, such as **Skype®** to communicate with the Studio.
- Cellular connections via Bluetooth or landline can be used as **backup** for the Internet link.

<Warning>
  At the Studio, the operator should **NOT send background music in the return feed**. \
  Only voices should be sent.\
  In applications like Skype®, communication is _half-duplex_, and background music could cause interruptions in the remote audio.
</Warning>

<Note>
  If Bluetooth is used to communicate with the radio station in an emergency, the **MIC-4/LIN/Bluetooth** control must remain closed to avoid a feedback loop.\
  The Bluetooth return feeds directly into the headphone mix.
</Note>

### About Studio Return Feed

- The mix generated in the console is sent via USB to the laptop, which transmits it to the Studio.
- From the laptop, the Studio return enters the console via USB, directly to the **headphone mix**.
- Connecting a microphone to the **MIC-3** input triggers the **USB return switching** to the headphone mix.
- In headphones, the operator hears both the Studio return and the program mix (**MIC-1, MIC-2, MIC-3**).

<Danger>
  In a two-way communication with Studio via Internet, a microphone must **ALWAYS be connected to the MIC-3 input**. This ensures the USB return is routed to the headphones.\
  If no microphone is connected to MIC-3:

  - The Studio return will not be heard.
  - The USB signal on the _MIC-3/USB_ control cannot be used, as it would send the Studio return to air.
</Danger>

## Case 2: High-Quality One-Way Communication

The diagram shows a scenario where the portable console operates as a **remote studio**, broadcasting to the main Studio through **high-quality audio streaming**.

### About Broadcasting

- The console connects via **USB to a laptop with Internet access**.
- Communication with the Studio is established from the laptop:
  - Using **Solidyne Audicom®** to generate the stream.
  - Or any other compatible encoding software.

  <Note>
    Skype® or other VoIP apps do not apply in this case, as they are voice-only, while here **stereo audio** high quality transmission is required.
  </Note>
- As **backup** options you can use:
  - A wired cell phone.
  - Or a landline connected to the console's RJ-11.

### About Studio Return Feed

- The one-way data flow allows sending **high-quality** audio, but dialogue with the Studio is not possible due to streaming delays.
- In this condition, **all signal is generated from the MX2100**.
- If Studio return feed is mandatory, it is recommended to do it through:
  - Cell phone (wired or via Bluetooth).
- The return is heard in headphones, without delay.

### About Available Signals

**Microphones and Lines**

- Available: MIC-1 and MIC-2.
- **MIC-3 remains unconnected**, to enable sending the USB input to air (audio from computer).

<Note>
  Connecting a microphone to MIC-3 **triggers the USB return switching to the headphone mix**, which only applies to two-way communication with Studio.
</Note>

**Cell Phone**

- A cell phone linked via **Bluetooth** allows broadcasting a remote interviewer or journalist (using _MIC-4/LIN/Bluetooth_ control).
- A second MX2100 can also be linked via cell phone.

<Note>
  When the console is connected via USB (to computer or charger), the internal **MIC-4 is disabled**, and the Bluetooth return appears instead.\
  This allows broadcasting a phone call when Bluetooth is not being used to link the MX2100 with Studio (assuming the main link is done through the computer).
</Note>

<Warning>
  The Bluetooth signal is always present in the headphone mix at a fixed level.\
  When sending Bluetooth to air through the _MIC-4/LIN/Bluetooth_ control, adjust by monitoring the console's VU meter.
</Warning>
