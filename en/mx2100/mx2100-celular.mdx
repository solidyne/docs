## Mobile Phone Bluetooth Connection

The MX2100 supports connecting a mobile phone via **Bluetooth** for transmission to studios or to add a mobile phone to the broadcast when linking through an external computer or landline.

- Compatible with any Bluetooth-enabled phone.
- Eliminates dependency on hands-free cables that vary by brand and model.
- Maximum distance: up to 5 meters; recommended: keep the phone on your person but separated from the console (shirt pocket or belt on the opposite side).
- Advantage: signal remains digital from the phone to inside the MX2100, achieving better audio quality.

### Pairing the Phone with the Console

Initial pairing only needs to be done once per phone. After that, connection is automatic when Bluetooth is activated on both devices.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Turn off Bluetooth on the console">
    Verify that the Bluetooth LED (located on the DTMF keypad) is off.

    - If it blinks green every 2 seconds → it's on.
    - To turn it off: hold down the **"#" and "9"** keys until the LED turns off.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate search mode on the console">
    With Bluetooth off, hold down **"#" and "9"** for ~10 seconds until the LED flashes rapidly alternating green/red.\
    This indicates the MX2100 has entered search mode.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search for devices on the phone">
    On the phone, start searching for Bluetooth devices.\
    The procedure depends on the model, consult your phone's manual.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the console">
    The phone will show the device **Solidyne BTM641** (on older models: BTM751).

    - If a code is requested: enter **0000**.
    - The MX2100 ID is stored in the phone.
    - The console LED changes to slow blinking green (one flash every 2 seconds), indicating active connection.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Bluetooth turns on by holding "#" and "9" (or any combination between rows 3 and 4) for ~5 seconds, releasing when green LED lights up.

  - Slow green = on.
  - Fast green/red = search mode.
</Warning>

<Note>
  On some phones, after detecting the device you need to press **"connect"** to activate it. Others activate it automatically.
</Note>

### Reconnecting a Paired Device

### Volume Adjustment

- Set the Bluetooth volume on the phone to **maximum** to obtain the best signal-to-noise ratio.
- Adjustment must be made **during a Bluetooth call**.
- Phone volume is independent of Bluetooth volume.
- The value is stored in the phone's memory.
- If you change phones, you'll need to readjust the level to maximum.

<Warning>
  If you adjust the volume without being on a Bluetooth call, you only change the phone's speaker volume, **not** the Bluetooth volume.
</Warning>

<Accordion title="Mobile Phone Cable Connection (obsolete)" icon="mobile">
  The **RJ-11 "Cellular&Phone"** connector allows connecting a mobile phone using a **hands-free** accessory.

  - Used as backup for external computer link, especially when Bluetooth is being used to broadcast another phone.
  - The phone transmits microphone (tip of miniplug) and speaker (ring) signals to the MX2100.
  - The console sends the program signal to the phone, which retransmits it to the radio.
  - Return from the radio arrives at the phone and then to the console, integrating into the headphone mix (STUDIO).
  - While using this connector, the phone's microphone and speaker are disconnected.
