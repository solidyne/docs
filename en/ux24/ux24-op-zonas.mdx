## UX24 Main Panel Zones and Controls

![Ux24 Operation Zones Jp](/images/ux24/ux24-operacion-zonas.jpg)

**A — Channel Controls**\
Traditional controls with faders, bus assignment buttons, ON AIR and Pre-Fader Listen (PFL).\
They operate conventionally and allow direct control of line inputs, VoIP and cellular via Bluetooth (through UNIDEX TELCO adapters).

**B — Touch Screen**\
7" screen used to operate multiple console functions.\
Includes 6 shortcut buttons and a rotary encoder.\
Both buttons and encoder are **context-sensitive controls**, their function varies according to the active screen.

**C — Monitoring and Talkback Zone**\
Area dedicated to monitoring control and talkback circuit.

**D — Remote Control**\
Enables remote operation and configuration of the console.\
Any computer with a web browser can access the console using its IP address.\
Useful for managing virtual channels, using a tablet as a fader extension, or setting up a remote studio.

## Main Screen

### Level Meters

The **PGM**, **REC**, **AUX** and **VBUS** meters display:

- Average level in **VU** (slow-moving blue bar).
- Peak level in **dBfs** (floating yellow segment).

The scale is calibrated in dBfs, where **-20 dBfs equals 0 VU**.\
The numerical value on the right shows the current maximum (in VU or dBfs) and toggles by touching the number.\
The main meter remains visible on all screens and can be switched between buses by touching the bus name on the left.

<Tip>
  **Note about levels:**\
  Meters show the **bus** level.

  - For digital outputs, the level matches the output level if gain is set to 0.
  - For analog outputs, 0 VU = -20 dBfs, with nominal levels of **+4 dBu** (balanced) and **0 dBu** (unbalanced).\
    If gain is set above nominal level, headroom is reduced and clipping may occur before the meter shows it.
</Tip>

### CUE Level

Shows the **CUE** bus level, after the physical level knob.

### Status

- **Unidex IP:** IP address for remote control. Enter in a web browser (recommended: Google Chrome) to access the control interface. Requires _Ethernet Remote Control_ port connection to LAN.

### ON AIR Counter

Starts an ascending count (**hh:mm:ss**) when microphones are activated. When turned off, the value remains on screen.

### Context Menu

Six buttons located below the screen provide quick access to main functions.\
Their function varies according to the active screen. Navigation and editing are done via touch screen and encoder.

Main screen shortcuts:

- **SETTINGS:** Advanced and system configuration (ADMIN only).
- **SCENE:** Scene and user profile management.
- **PROCESS:** Access to equalization, compression, de-esser and noise gate (available processes vary for each input).
- **VIRTUAL:** Pressing the encoder accesses the virtual channels control screen (12, 6 or none, depending on UX6 expansions).
- **MONITOR:** Audio source assignment for Studio and Control Room, with advanced monitoring functions.
- **TELCO:** Management of telephone lines, Bluetooth or VoIP, with level and gain controls.
- **CHANNEL:** Selected channel information and control, including gain, panning, processors and source reassignment.

<Note>
  **Power saving mode**
  Screens turn off after 15 minutes of inactivity.
