## Channels

- UNIDEX UX24 has 24 channels:

  12 channels with 100mm faders and 12 "virtual" channels operated from the touchscreen or remote web interface.
- Can be expanded with UX6 modules to have 18 or 24 physical faders.
- Each channel can be assigned to any input (except external tuner).
- Channels can be configured in three modes: **MIC**, **LINE** or **TELCO**, which modifies their behavior and functions.
- They can be assigned to four stereo mix buses: **PGM**, **REC**, **AUX** and **VBUS**.

## Inputs

- **Microphone (4 balanced mono)**

  With 48V phantom power, 4-band parametric EQ, dynamic compressor, noise gate and de-esser.
- **Line (4 balanced stereo)**

  With 3-band parametric EQ.
- **UNIDEX (16 mono / 8 stereo)**

  Balanced inputs configurable as mono or stereo.

  Allow connection of UNIDEX adapters (microphones, telephone lines, Bluetooth interfaces, etc.).

  Include 3-band parametric EQ, dynamic compressor and noise gates.
- **USB (4 stereo digital inputs)**

  ASIO 3.0 compatible. The connected computer recognizes four playback devices.

  Include 3-band parametric EQ.
- **AES-3 (4 stereo digital inputs)**

  With 3-band parametric EQ.
- **Incoming streaming**

  Not an independent input; when activated it replaces AES-3 input #1.
- **External tuner**

  Dedicated input for transmission monitoring.

## Outputs

There are 18 stereo outputs and 4 monitoring outputs:

- **Program (PGM)**

  Dual balanced stereo analog output.
- **4 balanced stereo (assignable)**
- **4 unbalanced stereo (assignable)**

  Can be configured as up to 8 mono outputs. Include **mix-minus** option for telephone and VoIP communications.
- **USB (4 assignable stereo sends)**

  The computer connected via USB detects these outputs as recording devices.
- **AES-3 (4 digital outputs)**

  Two of them are assignable to any of the buses.
- **Dual PCM/MP3 streaming**

  Simultaneous RTP and Icecast/Shoutcast streaming.

## Monitoring and Intercom

- Studio monitoring outputs (speakers and headphones).
- Simplified Studio monitoring connection with **Solidyne StudioBox** bays.
- Control Room monitoring outputs (speakers and headphones).
- Talk-back to Studio.
- Selectable talkback microphone: internal (PZM) or external.
- 4 intercom lines assignable to audio outputs.
- **Reverse talk-back**: allows talking from Studio to operator's CUE (requires Studiobox HD3 or HD5).
- CUE bus (Pre Fader Level) assignable to any output.

## External Device Triggering

Features:

- **4 GPI**
- **8 GPO** open-collector type

Allows triggering:

- Solidyne Audicom automation
- Audio processors
- Other devices with remote control

Activation is programmable (see corresponding section).
