## Monitoring Section

This section of the console assigns the signals to be heard through the monitor speakers and headphones in both the Studio and Control Room.\
Here you'll also find the **A** and **B** master microphone buttons, **CUE** level control, talkback microphone, and intercom groups.

The **selection controls** 1 and 2 are push-turn encoders.\
To select a signal source:

1. Turn the encoder: options will rotate on screen, flashing until confirmed.
2. Push the encoder to confirm: audio switching occurs at this moment.

If you turn the knob without confirming, after 10 seconds the change is canceled and display returns to previous source.

<Tip>
  Pushing the encoder without turning returns to the previous source (shown below current one in small text), allowing quick **toggling between two sources**.
</Tip>

#### 1 <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} />  Studio Monitor

Selects the source sent to **STUDIO MONITOR** output.\
Options: `AIR-IN`, `PGM`, `REC`, `AUX`, `VBUS`, `CUE`.

- Studio speakers and headphones level is adjusted from the touchscreen under **MONITOR**.

  Usually this level remains fixed and each participant adjusts their own level from a headphone distributor.
- In single-booth stations, monitor speakers can connect to **Control Room** output to use the physical volume knob.

#### 2 <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Control Room

Selects the source sent to **CONTROL ROOM** outputs.\
Options: `AIR-IN`, `PGM`, `REC`, `AUX`, `VBUS`.

<Note>
  **Control Room Speaker Muting:**\
  When using a microphone in the Control Room, you can configure the control speakers output to mute when activated (see _Channel Screen_).\
  This is also used in single-studio or "hot booth" stations by connecting monitoring speakers to the **Control Room** output and setting all microphones as "located in Control Room" to enable automatic muting.
</Note>

#### 3 <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Control Monitor Level

Rotary attenuator adjusting the level of speakers connected to **Control Room** output.\
The output is line-level for active or powered speakers. Maximum level achieved will also depend on the monitors' own settings.

#### 4 <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Control Headphones Level

Rotary attenuator for operator's headphones level (connected to **Control Room Headphones**).

#### 5 <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> CUE Level

Rotary attenuator for **CUE** bus level.\
The main screen shows a dBfs-calibrated meter reflecting the level after CUE control. If attenuator is closed, there will be no indication.

**SPEAKER** and **PHONES** buttons inject the CUE signal into Control Room speakers and/or headphones.

- When active, CUE signal is summed to the monitored signal (shown on SOURCE display).
- Main signal is automatically attenuated when CUE signal is present.
- Attenuation level is configured in **MONITOR → ADVANCED** screen.

CUE bus can be assigned to any output for auxiliary speakers connection. By default, it's assigned to **UNBAL 8**.

## Intercom and Talk-Back

### **INTERCOM**

Intercom buttons (see item 6 in image) link to console audio outputs to configure advanced talkback circuits. When pressing an Intercom button, talkback microphone audio interrupts the audio on that Intercom's associated output.

<Tip>
  **Application Cases:**

  - Create differentiated headphone groups to talk to everyone (with Talk-Back) or specific group (with Intercom).
  - Set up a Talk-Back button for Studio B.
</Tip>

<Note>
  **Using HD3 as Intercom**

  Download guide to install [Solidyne StudioBox HD3 as Intercom](http://www.solidyne.dx.com.ar/wordpress-files/DW/doc-guides/Studiobox-HD3_as_UX24s_Intercom_set.pdf).
</Note>

### **TALK-BACK**

When pressed, Talk-Back microphone is sent to STUDIO output (speakers and headphones). In headphones, Talk-Back plays through left channel while program signal (or other assigned signal) remains in right channel.

---

## MASTER-MIC Buttons

Simultaneously activate all microphone channels associated with button (A or B).\
Also activates Tally A or B signaling accordingly; and speaker muting on STUDIO output (MASTER MIC A) or audio output assigned to Studio B (MASTER MIC B).

---

## MONITOR Screen

Access by pressing **MONITOR** in main screen shortcuts.

CUE level meter shown in dBfs. Displayed level is post-CUE level knob. No level indication if knob is closed.

**CUE Reset**\
Turns off all active CUE buttons.

**ADVANCED**\
Shows level controls and advanced settings for monitoring signals.

<Note>
  To change a value, touch control and turn encoder. Push encoder to confirm.
</Note>

### Studio Speaker

Adjusts signal level for speakers connected to **Studio Monitor** output.\
Output is line-level, designed for active speakers.

### Studio Headphones

Adjusts signal level for headphones connected to **Studio Monitor** output.\
Intended to feed a headphone distributor.

<Warning>
  **Note on monitoring levels:**\
  Studio speakers and headphones output levels should be adjusted to avoid excessive amplification in active monitors or headphone distributor.\
  If console signal is too low and amplified later, signal-to-noise ratio degrades.
</Warning>

### On-Air Input Gain

Controls gain of **Air Monitor Input** (external tuner).

### Ring Level

Level of "ring" tone in **CUE**, generated by console when call comes in through landline or Bluetooth.

### Talkback Mic Level

Adjusts talkback microphone level to Studio monitoring, Intercom and telephone lines.

### Talkback Mic Source

Defines microphone input used for talkback (Studios, TELCO and Intercom).\
Options:

- Built-in ambient microphone
- Microphone inputs 1 to 4
- UNIDEX-4 L and UNIDEX-4 R
- DANTE #1 (when available)

Input assigned to talkback can also be assigned to a channel, for example, to put that microphone on-air.

### Control Room CUE Sum Audio Att

Sets attenuation of monitored signal in Control Room when CUE signal overlaps in speakers and/or headphones.\
This attenuation also applies when activating talkback button (to studios or telephone line) or Intercom.

#### Intercom Input

Adjusts **CUE** signal level from **StudioBox** accessories (reverse talkback).

**Intercom to CUE:** enables or disables Intercom return into CUE bus.
