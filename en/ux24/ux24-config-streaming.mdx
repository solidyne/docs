UX24 consoles can generate **two independent audio streams** and decode one incoming audio stream.

### Available streaming types

- **Streaming 1 (outgoing)**\
  Uses **RTP** protocol, ideal for transmitter site link (**STL**).
- **Streaming 2 (outgoing)**\
  Compatible with **Shoutcast/Icecast servers** for internet broadcasting.
- **Streaming 3 (incoming)**\
  Can be **RTP** or **public HTTP streaming**.\
  When enabled, the received audio is **automatically decoded and switched**, replacing the **AES-1** input.

### Signal source and send level

Streaming uses the **PROGRAM** signal taken from **AES-1** output, both for **Icecast/Shoutcast** server upload and **RTP** audio stream.

The default output level (gain=0) is **-20 dBfs** referenced to **0VU** (1 kHz @ 0VU = -20 dBfs).\
Gain is adjusted from **SETTINGS → OUTPUTS** screen.

<Warning>
  If you change the **AES-1** output gain, the streaming send level will also change.
</Warning>

## Streaming services configuration

It's done from the **SETTINGS** screen under **STREAMING** option.\
It shows four tabs to configure outgoing streaming services (UP-STREAM and RTP Link); incoming (DOWN-STREAM) and network options.

### UP-STREAM (TX)

The **UP-STREAM** tab allows configuring an **Icecast** or **Shoutcast** broadcast server to publish the program signal.

### UP-STREAM Icecast/Shoutcast

- **ENABLE/DISABLED**: Enables or disables streaming transmission when changes are confirmed by pressing **APPLY**.

  <Tip>
    To optimize system resources, keep it stopped when service is not in use.
  </Tip>
- **PROTOCOL**: Defines if server is Icecast or Shoutcast type.
- **SERVER IP**: Server destination IP address.
- **PORT**: Server TCP listening port.
- **MOUNTPOINT**: Unique name that identifies the stream on the server.
- **Stream NAME**: Name that identifies the stream.
- **CODEC**: Transmission audio format (Opus or MP3).
- **QUALITY**: Bitrate for encoding
- **PASSWORD**: Access password for publishing (if applicable).
- **APPLY**: Applies and saves changes and starts or stops transmission (according to ENABLE/DISABLED status).

<Note>
  Configuration parameters for Icecast/Shoutcast are provided by the server provider.
</Note>

### RTP LINK

The **RTP LINK** tab allows configuring streaming transmission to a specific IP address, for example, to send the program signal to a transmitter site (**STL**).

<Warning>
  Implementing an RTP link requires advanced network configuration knowledge.
</Warning>

- **ENABLE/DISABLED**: Enables or disables RTP streaming when changes are confirmed by pressing **APPLY**.

  <Tip>
    To optimize system resources, keep it stopped when service is not in use.
  </Tip>
- **DESTINATION ADDRESS**: Destination IP address.
- **PORT**: TCP transmission port.
- **CODEC**: Audio format for RTP (**PCM** / **MP3**).
- **QUALITY**: MP3 bitrate or PCM sampling rate.
- **GPO**: Enables sending **on-air light (Tally Light)** signals via TCP/IP for compatible Solidyne equipment.
  - **Studio A and B** (lines 1 and 2 respectively)
  - **Studio B and A** (reversed order)
  - **A+B** (signal activates on both lines, regardless of active studio)

### Down-Stream (RX)

Allows configuring an incoming stream. When **DOWN-STREAM** module is activated (**ENABLE**), the decoded audio is internally routed to **AES-1** input, which changes its name to **STREAM-1**.\
In this mode, the AES-1 connector on the rear panel is disabled.

- **RUN/STOP**\
  Starts or stops streaming decoding when changes are confirmed with **APPLY**.

  <Tip>
    To optimize system resources, keep it stopped when service is not in use.
  </Tip>
- **PROTOCOL**\
  Defines the incoming stream type. The following formats are supported:
  - Public **HTTP** and **MMS** streams encoded in PCM 16 (44.1/48 kHz), MP3 or Opus.
  - **RTP** streams in PCM 16 (44.1 kHz) and MP3.
- **SERVER URL/IP**\
  Name or IP address of the server generating the stream.
- **PORT**\
  TCP port where the stream enters.\
  Default value: **0**.
- **MOUNTPOINT**\
  Unique name that identifies the stream.
- **APPLY**\
  Applies configuration changes.

### Network (Streamer Module)

General network settings for the **UX24 Streamer** module (not to be confused with web control access).

By default, the IP address works in dynamic mode (DHCP). The assigned address is shown on the main screen as **STREAM IP**.

Accessing the streamer module's IP address from a computer on the network will allow viewing and configuring all its functions.
