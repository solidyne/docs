## Alarms

Access through **SYSTEM → ALARMS tab**.

<Danger>
  The parameters that trigger alarms are based on the **FM tuner** signal.

  - If RF Level < 40 dB or multipath > 10%, measurements are not valid.
  - In this case, fields appear dimmed and no alarms are generated.
</Danger>

The 542APC can send email alerts for the following events:

1. **AUDIO SILENCE**
2. **OVERMODULATION**
3. **LOW RF POWER**

### Alarms Configuration

![542 Alarms System Pn](/images/542/542-sistema-alarmas.png)

- **E-mail Send To** → address where alerts will be sent.
  - "Send Test" sends a test email.

<Note>
  To send alerts to multiple addresses, use the **mail forwarding** feature on the configured account.
</Note>

- **LOG and E-MAIL checkboxes** → enable internal memory logging and/or email sending.

### Alarm Types

- **AUDIO SILENCE**:
  - Triggers when the signal falls below the threshold defined in **Fail Backup**.
  - The time limit (seconds) is adjusted with a slider control.
  - Important: the **FM Receiver post-Gain** signal is analyzed, so gain affects detection.
- **OVERMODULATION**:
  - Activates if modulation exceeds the value defined in the alarm.
  - This setting **does not affect transmission**, only detection.
- **LOW RF POWER LEVEL**:
  - Activates when low transmission power is detected.
  - Procedure: press **Set REF** under normal conditions. Then define the % of loss that triggers the alarm.
  - Does not affect transmission.
- **SYSTEM START**:
  - Generates alarm when equipment restarts (e.g. power outage).
- **SYSTEM ERRORS**:
  - For internal use only. Events are logged in **SYSLOG**.
