## Local network connection

All configuration options and advanced settings of the **542APC** processor are accessed through the **WEB control interface**.

To access:

1. Connect the unit to a port on the local network **router or switch** using the **Ethernet Control port**.

   <Warning>
     Do not confuse the **Control Ethernet port** with the **AoIP Ethernet port** (models with Streamer/AoIP option).
   </Warning>

2. The **assigned IP address** is shown on the front panel OLED display.

   <discovery />
     
   <Info>
     By default, the 542APC works with dynamic IP (DHCP enabled):

     The router automatically assigns an available IP address.

     This address may change when the unit restarts.

     A **static IP** address can be assigned from the system screen to prevent IP changes.
   </Info>

3. Using a computer connected to the same LAN as the processor, enter the IP address in a **web browser** (Google Chrome recommended).

   <Info>
     It is recommended that the computer is connected to the LAN via **Ethernet cable**.\
     In some cases, a PC connected via Wi-Fi might not have permissions to access wired devices on the same network.

## Remote access via Internet

### Units with STREAMER AoIP module

In units equipped with the _STREAMER AoIP_ expansion (with _serial number AD_ and later), Internet access to the processor is simplified through a service that generates a fixed link.

### Units without STREAMER AoIP

If the unit does not have the **simplified service**, it can be accessed from outside the LAN in two ways:

#### 1. Using Remote Desktop software

A simple method that requires no major configuration is to use **remote desktop** software (TeamViewer, Anydesk, Parsec, etc.) to access a LAN computer connected via Ethernet to the processor.

- From that local computer, open a web browser and access the **542APC web interface**.
- This allows remote processor configuration and even firmware updates without risks.
- Communication between the PC and processor occurs within the **local network**.
- Internet is only involved in remote control of the computer.

<Tip>
  This method is the safest and simplest for remote support, as it requires no network configuration changes.
</Tip>

#### 2. Configure external access to the unit's IP

The second option involves installing the processor with a **static IP address** and configuring the local network to allow external access to that address.

This involves:

- **Port forwarding** configuration.
- Contracting **static public IPs** and/or using **dynamic DNS** services.

<Warning>
  This procedure requires advanced networking knowledge.\
  Consulting with a network administration specialist is recommended.
