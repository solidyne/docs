## FM Tuner

The **internal FM tuner** enables measurements of the received radio signal.\
Access it from the SETUP side menu, under **FM RECEIVER – ANALYZER**.

- Usually the tuned station is the same one where the processor operates.
- Any other station can also be tuned to view its parameters.

The tuner is linked to a **modulation monitor** that displays different aspects of the transmission in real-time by analyzing the received RF signal.

<Warning>
  Measurements are only valid when the station is properly tuned.

  - If RF level is **below 40 dB** or multipath exceeds **10%**, measurements are **not valid**.
  - Under these conditions, data fields appear dimmed.
</Warning>

### Tuner Controls

- **ON/OFF** → turns the FM tuner on or off.\
  If reception is very poor, the unit turns off automatically.
- **FREQ** → enter the station frequency (MHz, use decimal point, e.g. 95.9).
  - Type the value using the keyboard and confirm with **ENTER**.
  - If it was off, the tuner turns on.

### Reception Parameters

- **Reception Quality:** Reception validity indicators:
  - Show if signal quality allows reliable measurements.
  - Otherwise, out-of-range variables are displayed: _RF low level_, _Multipath_, _Noise_, _Adjacent channel interference_.
- Reception quality depends on the **connected antenna**.\
  (See **FM Receiver Antenna** section).
- **RF LEVEL** → RF signal level at antenna. Must be \> 40 dB.
- **Multipath** → distortion percentage due to reflections. Must be \< 10%.
- **Band Type** → FM band type according to region.
- **RBDS Mode** → activates RBDS system (RDS version used in USA).

### DIAL SCAN

Tool that scans the FM band in **100 kHz** steps and generates a graph showing signal strength for each detected station.

## Transmission Analysis

### FM Measurements

Monitoring of parameters measured on the tuned signal:

![542 FM ANALYZER Pn](/images/542/542-FM_ANALYZER.png)

- **TOTAL MODULATION** → FM modulation level measured on the tuned signal.
- **MODULATION MEASUREMENT RESPONSE** → measurement integration time:
  - Instantaneous
  - 125 µs (recommended for peak)
  - 250 µs
  - 500 µs
  - 1 ms

    <Note>
      Appropriate integration depends on regional standards.
    </Note>
- **PILOT** → pilot tone modulation % (default: 9%).
- **RDS** → RDS subcarrier modulation % (default: 4%).
- **AUDIO L/R** → audio level (dBFS).
- **CARRIER OFFSET** → carrier deviation (kHz).
- **RDS BER** (bit error ratio) → RDS data quality.
  - 0% = no errors.
  - 100% = unreadable data.
- **RDS DATA** → RDS transmitted texts.

### Channel Separation, Distortion and SNR

The system measures:

- Channel separation.
- Total harmonic distortion + noise (THD+N).
- Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

These measurements consider the **complete chain**: processor + stereo encoder + transmitter + antenna.

- Can be done **remotely** without interrupting transmission.
- During the process:
  - A very brief audible tone is injected (~250 ms).
  - For SNR, the on-air signal is muted for 2 seconds.

**Procedure**

- Click the **RUN new measurement** option shown to the right of the parameter.
- This executes the measurement for that parameter and displays the result.

**Channel Separation Scale**

| Separation (dB) | Rating       |
| :-------------: | :---------: |
| **\> 40 dB**    | **Excellent** |
| 35 to 40 dB     | Very good   |
| 30 to 35 dB     | Good        |
| 25 to 30 dB     | Fair        |
| \< 25 dB        | Poor        |

<Info>
  Separation can be optimized from the stereo encoder advanced controls.\
  See **Channel Separation Measurement and Adjustment**.

### Technical Transmission Report

- The **DOWNLOAD FULL TEST** button runs all measurements and generates a text file with results, including FM Analyzer values.
- The file is saved to the browser's downloads folder.
- This report can be sent to **Technical Support** for remote diagnosis.
- If the tuner is off, reports cannot be generated. To turn it on: press **ON/OFF** and wait for values to stabilize.

<Warning>
  The report introduces **brief audible tones on-air** during measurements.
