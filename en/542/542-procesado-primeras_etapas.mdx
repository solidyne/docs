## Introduction

Processing stages are accessed from the **SETUP** screen, **PROCESS** option in the side menu.

- Different stages are grouped in **tabs**.
- The left-to-right order corresponds to the **actual signal flow**, except for **WIZARD**, which is not a processing stage itself.

Available stages:

1. WIZARDS
2. ENHANCERS
3. ENHANCER EQ
4. AGC
5. MULTIBAND AGC
6. MULTIBAND LIMITER
7. MIX & CLIPPER – FINAL LIMITER

## WIZARD

The **WIZARD** controls work on user presets.\
They allow you to **quickly change the sound character** and create new presets without modifying each individual stage.

- No advanced knowledge required.
- Related: see **Preset Management**.

Main functions:

1. Modify a preset's character in four essential aspects:
   - **BASS**
   - **BRIGHT**
   - **COMPRESSION**
   - **LOUDNESS**
2. Toggle and basic adjustment of **ENHANCERS**:
   - Voice Symmetrizer
   - EQ
   - Bass Enhancer
   - Stereo Enhancer

Each WIZARD control modifies multiple parameters across different stages in a synchronized way.

#### Control Interaction

- The four controls are interrelated: a single parameter can be affected by more than one control.
- When one control is moved, the positions of others are recalculated.
- When loading a preset, controls are positioned according to its settings.

This allows you to **visualize at a glance** the sonic characteristics of each preset and compare them.

#### Usage Tips

- Use WIZARD for **moderate changes**.
- Always start from a preset close to the desired result.
  - Example: if seeking maximum loudness, don't start from a soft preset and maximize **LOUDNESS**.
  - It's recommended to start from a **MaxLoudness** type preset, already optimized for that goal.

<Note>
  Advanced users can adjust each stage individually for greater sound precision.

## Enhancers

### Voice Symmetrizer

Human voice is asymmetric due to vocal cord nature (asymmetric triangular pulses). This asymmetry remains after vocal cavity filtering.

As a result, when passing through a compressor:

- One polarity reaches 100%, while the opposite rarely exceeds 50%.
- Voice is perceived less intense than music, which is more symmetric.

To correct this phenomenon without altering sound quality, **peak symmetrizers** are used.

  Technique based on Dr. Kahn's discoveries and developed by Eng. Oscar Bonello.\

### Expander

- Its purpose is to **improve the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)** of the on-air sound.
- Multiband compression increases loudness but reduces S/N.
- Without an expander, noise floor might be audible during long voice pauses.

**Available control:**

- **THS (Threshold):** adjusts in dBFS the level at which the expander starts reducing gain.

---

### Bass Enhancer

- Reinforces **mid-bass (50 – 300 Hz)**, improving presence on small speakers.
- Unlike an EQ, it **synthesizes and adds harmonics** from lower frequencies.

**Controls:**

- **FREQUENCY:** low-pass filter cutoff frequency (defines harmonic range).
- **INTENSITY:** amount and intensity of generated harmonics.
- **SUB-GAIN:** level of synthesized bass added to the signal.

<Note>
  When using preset switching for voices, music and voice settings should have **BASS ENHANCER** in the same condition (active or inactive).
</Note>

---

### Stereo Enhancer

- Provides a **more immersive sound**, making the station stand out against conventional broadcasts.
- This effect helps increase perceived loudness.
- The effect is more noticeable on headphones.
- Uses a **stereo expansion** algorithm to simulate surround sound in two-channel systems.

**Controls:**

- **Cut Freq (Hz):** low-pass filter cutoff frequency defining the phase-shifted signal range. Hearing is more sensitive to phase differences below 2000 Hz → increasing phase difference widens stereo image.
- **Intensity:** level of expanded signal added to original audio.

<Note>
  In voice-switched presets, music and voice should maintain **Stereo Enhancer** in the same condition (enabled/disabled).
</Note>

### Enhancer EQ

**4-band** parametric equalizer. Corrections should be applied over ranges smaller than the global processing band (LOW, MID1, MID2, PRES, HI). Special care needed in frequencies **< 800 Hz** (LOW and M1).

**Reference Q factor:**

- Q=3 → width ≈ ½ octave.
- Q=4 → width ≈ ⅓ octave.

**Example:**

-3 dB attenuation centered at 250 Hz with Q=2 → width of 125 Hz. This frequency falls within **M1 (125 – 800 Hz)**.

- The correction affects ≈ 50% of that band (125-375 Hz).
- Higher Q means more specific correction.
- With Q=0.5 → width of 500 Hz, affecting LOW and M1.

<Info>
  In some cases, applying correction from either the **parametric EQ** or the **multiband density EQ** may be preferred, depending on the desired effect.\
  Both produce subtly different results.
</Info>

#### Recommendations

- Use parametric EQ for **very specific cuts or boosts**.
- The global equalization profile should be defined with **multiband AGC** and **density EQ**.
