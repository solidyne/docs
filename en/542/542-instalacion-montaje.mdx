## Mounting Recommendations

- The unit is designed for mounting in a **standard 19" rack**. Requires 1U height.
- If placing the unit on a shelf, attach the factory-supplied **rubber feet** to the base.
- Do not place the unit on an unstable surface or shelf; it could fall, causing damage to people and equipment.
- The **ambient temperature** must be between **5ºC and 40ºC**.
- Avoid direct sunlight or proximity to heat sources.
- The 542APC has **internal RF field protection**, allowing mounting near transmitters.
- Avoid strong electromagnetic fields (transformers, motors, etc).

<Warning>
  Place the equipment on a stable surface in a controlled environment. Avoid direct heat, electromagnetic fields and vibrations.
</Warning>

### Rack Mounting

- The unit does not use forced ventilation. Leave one rack unit of free space below and above the processor to facilitate heat dissipation.
- Always use **flat head screws** with **flexible washers** (plastic or rubber).
- Tighten the **lower** screws first, then the **upper** ones, to prevent the unit's weight from creating leverage on the upper angles.
- Do not apply excessive force when tightening. Light pressure is sufficient to secure the unit.

<Warning>
  Excessive pressure on the screws can deform or even break the front panel angles.
</Warning>

## Power Supply

- The unit works with **manual voltage selection** between **200/240V or 100/130V**.

  <Danger>
    Verify the correct position of the **voltage selector** on the rear panel.
  </Danger>
- Mains voltage must remain within a variation margin less than **10%**.\
  Otherwise, use fast-action stabilizers (ferroresonance or electronic).
- Power is controlled through the **main switch**.
- The unit has a **1A main fuse**.

<Warning>
  Do not use adapters that bypass the ground pin of the Interlock cable. \
  The entire installation must have proper **grounding**.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  It is recommended to follow regional grounding standards.

  - **USA:** NEC Article 810; ANSI/NFPA No. 70-1984
  - **Argentina:** IRAM 2379 and 2281-3
</Tip>

<Info>
  The power cable should not be installed alongside audio cables, especially those carrying analog audio.

13. External **antenna** for tuner (BNC)
14. **GPIO** (DB9)
15. Ethernet port for **audio stream** link
16. Reserved for future use.

## FM Receiver Antenna

<Info>
  The 542APC's internal receiver allows:

  Tuning to any station's transmission.

  Displaying modulation level, audio levels and RDS information, among other parameters.
</Info>

### Antenna Connection

The **Receiver FM ANT** connector is **BNC** type.

Two antennas are supplied from factory:

- **Extendable mini telescopic antenna**
  - Suitable for most installations.
- **BNC micro-antenna**
  - Recommended when RF field strength is very high.
  - The telescopic antenna could cause tuner saturation (the **RF LVL** indicator on the FM Monitor Analyzer stays fixed at _100 dBuV_).
  - In this case, use the lower-gain BNC micro-antenna.

### External Antennas

Depending on installation conditions (equipment location, distance to transmitter plant, etc.), installing an external **FM antenna** may be convenient.

<Note>
  External antennas are not included with the equipment.
