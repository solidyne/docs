## Introduction

**Monaural** broadcasting, while not a widespread practice, is used by some FM stations located in cities with **high congestion** and limited control/regulation of the electromagnetic spectrum.

When the broadcast content is primarily **spoken word** (magazines, news, sports, journalistic programs), stereo transmission offers no significant advantages, as its benefit is mainly limited to music.

## Technical advantages of mono mode

- Improves station **coverage range**.
- Significantly reduces **interference**.
- The energy that in stereo is dispersed across a wider bandwidth is concentrated in just **one quarter of the bandwidth** in mono.
- This increases **effective on-air power by up to 4 times** (_NAB Engineering Handbook_).
- Improves **coverage** by reducing:
  - Interference from nearby stations.
  - Multipath distortion in urban areas.

## Strategic use of mono mode

Mono transmission can be used in a **programmed** way to:

- Improve reception and coverage during **talk show programs**.
- Compete for audience in time slots where intelligibility is more critical than musicality.
- Alternate between **mono and stereo** based on broadcast content or schedule.

## Ways to switch to mono

- **By preset:**\
  Each preset can include an attribute that activates MONO mode when selected.\
  The processor will remain in MONO until modified by a new preset.
- **Microphones on-air (GPI):**\
  Using the GPI input, switch to a **VOICE** preset with MONO mode activated.\
  (See **GPIO** section for more details).
- **Manual control:**\
  Through the **Lite Commander** control application.
- **Automatic scheduling:**\
  Through programming in **Lite Commander**.
