## Accessing the STREAMER module

### From a LAN

Processors equipped with the STREAMER AoIP module have **two Ethernet ports**:

- **Ethernet**→ web interface for CONTROL
- **Ethernet AoIP** → AUDIO STREAM

  />

1. Connect the **Ethernet AoIP** port to the LAN using a CAT5 UTP cable. Factory default is DHCP. When connection is successful, the green LED on the RJ45 blinks.
2. To find the IP address assigned to the Streamer module, download the **Solidyne Multi-Discovery** application.

<discovery />

3. Once we access the module, we proceed with configuration.

### Remote access via Internet 

The 542APC units with STREAMER AoIP expansion include a redirection service that avoids advanced configurations (port forwarding, static IP contracting, etc.).

<Warning>
  This service provides remote access to the equipment's **web control and adjustment interface**.\
  It does not establish an audio link with the processor.
</Warning>

The service is provided by third parties. Solidyne offers free temporary activation limited to 4 hours of connection.

**Activating redirection**

1. Access the equipment from the LAN.
2. In the **SYSTEM** menu, open the **Internet Access** tab.
3. Enable the **ENABLE** button.
4. Request account activation by writing to [**soporte@solidyne.ar**](mailto:soporte@solidyne.ar) with:
   - Subject: "ZROK account activation for remote access"
   - Email to register
   - Processor serial number
5. Enter the received key in **ENTER KEY** on the Internet Access screen.

<Info>
  The free ZROK service enables 4-hour sessions.\
  For continuous access, the service must be contracted from the external provider.
</Info>

## Integrated control interface

542APC processors with STREAMER AoIP module include an integrated interface that provides access to audio streaming services and the Web Control interface.\
Access requires username and password.

- **BASIC** user → access to Remote Control (audio, MPX and reception settings)
- **ADMIN** user → enables all options, including audio stream configuration

Default password: **1234** (can be changed on hardware screen)

The **HOME** screen includes access to:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **HOME** | Loads the current screen. |
| **STREAM CFG** | Loads options for streaming services configuration. |
| **REMOTE CNTRL** | Loads screen for remote configuration of processing parameters and modulation monitor. |
| **SYSTEM** | Shows local network configuration options for the control Ethernet port, system information and configuration for external Internet access. |
| **UPDATE** | Simplified firmware update. |
| **REMOTE PLAYER** | Allows listening to processor audio through local network and Internet. |
| **LOG OUT** | Closes user session and returns to login screen. |

### Streaming configurations (STREAM CFG)

The **STREAM CFG** menu configures streaming services:

- UP-STREAM (Tx)
- RTP-LINK (Tx) 
- DOWN-STREAM (Rx)
- REMOTE PLAYER
- SERVICE CFG

## Down-stream RTP - Link (STL)

First we describe **audio stream** reception, as it is the most common case for establishing connection between the processor and radio studios (STL, _Studio to Transmitter Link_).

**Concept.** The processor receives an **RTP** audio stream generated by an encoder at the studios (for example, a Solidyne DX816 console, UNIDEX line or other compatible equipment).

### **Network configuration**

There are different configurations to interconnect two devices located in different locations. Network installation and configuration are beyond this manual; consult specialized technicians. For reference, two general schemes are mentioned.

1. **Point-to-point link**

Two networks in different locations connect directly (wirelessly or via fiber optic) to form a single **LAN**. There are companies that provide these services.\
In this scheme the processor is **on the same network** as the codec or transmitting equipment; **Internet is not involved**.

The point-to-point link can be:

- **Physical**: fiber intranet
- **Wireless**: microwave in WI-FI band or **Wi-Max 5.8 GHz**. These links reach up to **50 km** and have low costs as they use mass-produced equipment. The **5.8 GHz** band is free for data transmission.

2. **Internet link**

Two separate networks connect through **Internet**. Configuration is more complex: it usually requires setting up a **VPN** with compatible routers and/or having **fixed public IPs** and **port forwarding**.

The **encoder equipment configuration** may vary depending on network architecture.

<Note>
  For reference, see requirements document [**RTP_AudioStream_Link(STL)\_requirements**](https://www.solidynepro.com/DW/VPN-PortForwarding.pdf).

### Configure incoming RTP

The 542APC acts as a **passive receiver** of an **RTP** audio stream generated by equipment/encoder that broadcasts in a **compatible format**. It is only necessary to configure **protocol**, **port** and **IP address** through which the stream enters.

  alt="542 Streamer Decoder Jp"
  title="542 Streamer Decoder Jp"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"59%" }}
/>

1. It is assumed that the processor is properly connected to the **same LAN** as the encoder equipment, through the **Ethernet AoIP port**.
2. In the **General Status Screen**, choose **STREAM CFG** option.
3. Select the **DOWN-STREAM (Rx)** tab.

    <img
      src="/images/542/542-streamer-down_stream.png"
      alt="542 Streamer Down Stream Pn"
      title="542 Streamer Down Stream Pn"
      style={{ width:"97%" }}
    />
4. Activate reception with **RUN/STOP → RUN**.
5. In **PROTOCOL**, choose **RTP**.
6. In **SERVER URL/IP**, enter the **encoder's IP** (the one generating streaming at the Studio).\
   It is also possible to enter **0.0.0.0** to receive from **any IP** transmitting to the declared UDP port.
7. In **PORT**, enter the **UDP port** through which RTP arrives (must match the one defined in the encoder).
8. Verify that the encoder broadcasts in a **compatible** format:
   - **PCM 44.1 kHz**
   - **MP3 CBR/VBR 96–320 kbps**
9. **PATH/MOUNT POINT** is not used for **RTP**. Leave blank.
10. Press **APPLY** to confirm.
11. The processor will start **receiving audio** from the studios. The **signal level** is shown on screen.
