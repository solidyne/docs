## Audio inputs

In advanced mode (**SETUP**), select **AUDIO INPUT** from the side menu.\
Each input has the following controls:

![542 Web Inputs Pn](/images/542/542-web-inputs.png)

### Gain (GAIN)

- Adjusts the input signal level within a range of **±14 dB**.
- For analog inputs, **0 dB** corresponds to **+4 dBu**, referenced to **-18 dBfs (AES K18)**.\
  This provides **18 dB of headroom**.

<Tip>
  Gain should be adjusted so that **0 VU peaks at the console** oscillate between **-22 and -9 dBfs** on the processor's level meter.
</Tip>

### Trim R

- Gain compensation for the right channel.
- Adjustment range: **±3 dB**.
- Allows correction of **channel imbalances**.

### ST/MONO

- Switches the input between:
  - **STEREO**
  - **MONO** (sum of left and right channels).

### Main and alternative inputs

The 542APC automatically switches between inputs based on signal presence or absence.

- A **main input** is defined.
- Up to **two alternative inputs** can be configured (FAIL BACKUP 1 and 2).
- The unit switches in this order:
  1. Main input
  2. FAIL BACKUP 1
  3. FAIL BACKUP 2

#### Switching parameters

- **LEVEL** → threshold below which the signal is considered failed.
  - Adjustable between **-45 and -80 dB** (5 dB steps).
- **FAIL TIME** → time in seconds that the signal must remain below the **LEVEL** threshold to trigger switching.

### Input filters

- **HI PASS** (Chebyshev type)
  - Options: 0 (disabled), 20 Hz (factory default), 40 Hz, 60 Hz, 80 Hz.
  - Eliminates subsonic signals, typically picked up by microphones.
- **LOW PASS**
  - Options: 15 kHz, 16 kHz, 20 kHz.
  - Can be disabled (**None**).

## Audio outputs

In advanced mode (**SETUP**), select **AUDIO OUTPUT** from the side menu.

The processor has **four audio outputs**, each with **independent level adjustment.**

![542 Web Outputs Pn](/images/542/542-web-outputs.png)

1. **Balanced analog output** (XLR)
2. **Unbalanced analog output** (RJ45)
3. **AES-3 digital output**
4. **Ethernet streaming (AoIP)**

### PRE-emphasis

All outputs feature **pre-emphasis** switching. When activated, the output includes the 50 uS or 75 uS emphasis curve, according to configuration.

Pre-emphasized output is used in configurations where the exciter or transmitter applies de-emphasis to the input audio.

### Signal source switching

The **RJ45 analog**, **AES-3 digital**, and **AoIP** outputs can be configured to send:

- Processed signal.
- Signal from the FM receiver.

<Info>
  When an output transmits the FM receiver signal, the output level reflects the **actual on-air level**, assuming: Modulation = 100%; **FM Receiver** input gain = 0 dB.
