## Stereo Processor and Encoder for FM

This is the standard use as an **FM audio processor**.\
The unit is located at the **transmitter site** and connects via **MPX output** to the main transmitter.

- The **secondary MPX output** allows connection to a backup transmitter.
- The program signal enters through the **analog inputs**.

<Warning>
  Always use the appropriate input (**balanced or unbalanced**) according to your console.
</Warning>

When the transmitter site is remote from the studio, the processor is installed at the site and receives the program audio (PGM) through a point-to-point link, which can be:

- RF audio link.
- Digital audio via fiber optic or UHF.

### USB Output for External Streaming

Requires the **Audimax 362HD/USB** model.\
The **USB connection operates independently from MPX**, allowing the same on-air processing to be used for Internet streaming.

- The processor receives the program signal through analog inputs.
- Sends processed audio to both **USB digital output** and **MPX outputs**.
- A computer receives the audio via USB for streaming.

Therefore:

- **MPX** → FM transmitter.
- **USB** → streaming computer.

<Note>
  It is recommended to install **remote access** software on the computer to facilitate streaming system monitoring.

## FM Rebroadcast of Incoming Stream

This setup also requires the **Audimax 362HD/USB** model and an external computer.\
It is used, for example, in **relay stations**.

- An external computer receives the stream from the main station (via Internet or LAN).
- Decodes it and sends **PCM** to the processor through USB connection.
- The Audimax 362 processes the audio and delivers it to the **MPX outputs**, feeding the FM transmitter.

<Note>
  It is recommended to install **remote access** software on the computer for streaming encoder monitoring.
</Note>

## Uses as Audio Processor (HD Mode)

In **HD mode (High Definition)**, the Audimax 362HD can be used in applications requiring dynamic control or loudness enhancement **without FM transmission** (MPX disabled; see [HD Mode](/es/362/362-instalacion-audio)).

### Application Examples:

- Digital radio stations (HD Radio).
- High-quality streaming transmission.
- Audio pre-processing in remote units.
- Sound reinforcement in small shows or rehearsal rooms.
- Venues, auditoriums, conferences and background music systems.

In this mode:

- Peak control maximizes digital range usage, with minimal safety headroom (2-3 dB) to prevent coding overshoots.
- A **soft clipper** is coupled to the audio outputs, limiting post-multiband compressor peaks and protecting PA power stages.
- The combination of **AGC** and **multiband compression** maintains uniform and clear sound, independent of input signal variations.
