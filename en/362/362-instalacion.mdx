## Mounting

Consider the following recommendations when installing:

- Solidyne Audimax 362HD processors are designed for installation in a standard 483 mm (19") rack, occupying one rack unit.\
  It can also be placed on a desk using the provided self-adhesive rubber feet.
- Ambient temperature must be maintained between **5 °C and 40 °C**.\
  Avoid direct sunlight exposure on the processor, as well as proximity to heat sources or strong electromagnetic fields (power transformers, large motors, etc.).\
  Its internal RF field protection allows mounting near AM/FM transmitters.

<Danger>
  Avoid installation in very humid places or salty atmospheres, as this can cause corrosion on printed circuits and electronic components.
