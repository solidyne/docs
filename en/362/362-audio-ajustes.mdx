## Input Level

The Audimax 362HD **does not have manual input level control**.\
Adjustment is automatic through the **AGC system**.

- The rear panel has input connectors for **balanced (XLR and RJ45)** and **unbalanced (RCA)** equipment.
- It can be connected to non-professional consoles (-10 dBV) up to broadcast consoles with balanced outputs of +4 dBu or even +8/+12 dBu.
- The **AGC eliminates level variations** inherent to operation or recorded material:
  - If the level remains low, it compensates the signal to maintain uniform output.
  - If the level constantly exceeds 0 VU, it attenuates to prevent overload.

This way, the program signal reaches the processing stages with a constant level, achieving uniform on-air sound with consistent processing.

### Verifying Input Level

The AGC (image section 2) has a three-stage indicator:

/>

- The first LED (green) should remain lit when music or voice is present.
- The second LED (yellow) should light on peaks or remain steadily lit.
- The third LED (red) **should never remain permanently lit**.

## Sound Customization

The **Audimax 362HD** has been designed for easy and intuitive operation. No specialized knowledge in audio processing is required to set it up and adjust its sound.

Initial setup: simply set all controls to center position... and that's it!\
You'll be on air with proper sound.

Sound customization is done through **seven rotary controls** on the front panel.

### Dynamic Equalizer

The 3-band dynamic equalizer acts on the **compression thresholds** of each band.\
Unlike a conventional equalizer, **its effect increases with higher signal levels**.

- Ensure that the multiband compressor **is working** (check "Multiband compressor" LEDs).
- Adjust the _Dynamic Equalizer_ knobs for **bass, mid, and treble**:
  - Turn left → increases compression in that band.
  - Turn right → decreases compression, releasing the band and enhancing those frequencies.

<Note>
  It's advisable to maintain a balanced relationship between the three bands. Extreme differences create imbalance between bass, mids, and treble.
</Note>

- For bass impact, release this band slightly more than mids and treble.
- Remember that listeners can boost bass on their receivers; therefore, it's better to deliver clean, not over-compressed bass.

### Band Energy

These controls **increase peak density in the bands** by modifying compressor **recovery times**.

- Turn right → **compact and aggressive** sound (fast recovery).
- Turn left → **soft sound with more dynamics** (slow recovery).

### Multiband Compressor

This is the heart of processing. The indicators show the **band compressors** action.

/>

The **Multiband** control adjusts the input gain to the compressors.\
This control has the most impact on **station loudness**.

- Turn left → softer sound, less processed, with lower energy.
- Turn right → stronger sound, with more energy, but less dynamics and naturalness.

<Warning>
  Excessive processing can result in a very loud but **squashed** sound (no dynamics) and unnatural voices.
</Warning>

<Info>
  An appropriate working level is achieved when multiband compressor indicators are active without reaching maximum.
</Info>

- For natural and balanced voices: medium or lower position of Multiband control.
- For more intense processing: use **slow recovery** times (Band Energy toward the left).

## Control Relationships

For **Dynamic EQ** and **Band Energy** to work, the **multiband compressor must be active**. This means at least the first LEDs in each band should light up.\
Without multiband compression, the controls have no effect since they are associated with compression operation.
