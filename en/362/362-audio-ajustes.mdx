## Input level
The Audimax 362HD **does not have manual input level control**.\
Adjustment is automatic, through the **AGC system**.
- On the rear panel there are input connectors for **balanced (XLR and RJ45)** and **unbalanced (RCA)** equipment.
- It can be connected from non-professional consoles (–10 dBV) to broadcasting consoles with balanced outputs of +4 dBu or even +8/+12 dBu level.
- The **AGC eliminates level variations** inherent to operation or recorded material:
- If the level remains low, it compensates the signal to maintain uniform output.
- If the level constantly exceeds 0 VU, it attenuates to prevent overload.
This way, the program signal reaches the processing stages with a constant level, achieving a uniform on-air sound and always with the same degree of processing.
### Verifying the input level
The AGC (image section 2) has a three-instance indicator:

/>
- The first LED (green) should remain lit in the presence of music or voice.
- The second LED (yellow) should light up on peaks or light up steadily.
- The third LED (red) **should never remain permanently lit**.

## Sound customization
The **Audimax 362HD** has been designed for easy and intuitive operation. No specialized knowledge in audio processing is required to set it up and adjust its sound.
Initial configuration: simply place all controls in the center... and ready! \
You'll be broadcasting with correct sound.
Sound customization is done using **seven rotary controls** on the front panel.

### Dynamic Equalizer
The 3-band dynamic equalizer acts on the **compression thresholds** of each band.\
Unlike a conventional equalizer, **its effect increases with higher signal levels**.
- Make sure that the multiband compressor **is triggered** (LEDs "Multiband compressor").
- Adjust the _Dinamic Equalizer_ knobs for **bass, mids and treble**:
- To the left → increases compression in that band.
- To the right → decreases compression, releasing the band and enhancing those frequencies.
<Note>
It is advisable to maintain a balanced relationship between the three bands. Extreme differences create an imbalance between bass, mids, and treble.
</Note>
- To achieve impact in bass, release this band a little more compared to mids and treble.
- Remember that the listener can enhance bass in their receiver; therefore, it's better to deliver a sound with clean and not over-compressed bass.
### Band Energy
These controls **increase the peak density in the bands**, modifying the **recovery times** of the compressor.
- To the right → **compact and aggressive** sound (quick recovery).
- To the left → **soft sound with greater dynamics** (slow recovery).
### Multiband compressor
It's the heart of the processing. The indicators show the action of the **band compressors**.

The **Multiband** control adjusts the input gain to the compressors.\
It is the control that most impacts the **loudness of the radio**.
- To the left → soft sound, less processed, with less energy.
- To the right → strong sound, with more energy, but with less dynamics and less naturalness.
<Warning>
Excessive processing can give a very loud but **flattened** sound (with no dynamics at all) and unnatural voices.
</Warning>
<Info>
An adequate working level is achieved when the multiband compressor indicators act without lighting up to the maximum.
</Info>
- For natural and balanced voices: medium or lower position of the Multiband control.
- For more intense processing: use **slow recovery** times (Band Energy to the left).

## Relationship between controls
For **Dynamic EQ** and **Band Energy** to work, the **multiband compressor must be active**. This means that at least the first LEDs must light up in each band.\
Without multiband compression, the controls have no effect, as they are associated with compression work.
