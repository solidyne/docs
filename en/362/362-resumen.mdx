The **Solidyne Audimax 362HD processor** integrates **7 processing stages** plus a **stereo generator** in a single unit.\
Its main feature is its **ease of use**, as it does not require a specialized technician to make adjustments.

- No manual input level adjustment. Features **high-level balanced inputs** (XLR and RJ45) and **low-level unbalanced inputs (RCA)**.
- Its **automatic gain control (AGC)** adapts the input compensating for level differences over a wide range (30 dB).

The ability to work without pre-emphasis/de-emphasis also makes it an excellent processor for **WEBcasting** (streaming).

The processor operates in **3 bands**, fully controlled by **VCA (Voltage Controlled Amplifiers)**, which simplifies its adjustment.

The **stereo generator** uses **16x oversampling digital synthesis**, a technology developed by Solidyne that ensures:

- Ultra-low distortion.
- High channel separation.
- Maintenance-free operation throughout its service life.

The **MPX output** to the transmitter is differential type, which cancels possible residual hum in the signal.
