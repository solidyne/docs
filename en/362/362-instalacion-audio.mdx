## USB Digital Input/Output

The **Audimax 362HD/USB** model includes an optional module to send and receive audio through a PC connection using a standard USB A/B cable.

- When connected to a **<sup>Windows©</sup>** computer, the system automatically recognizes the processor and installs the necessary drivers.\
  No additional drivers are required.
- The unit is recognized as a **stereo sound card**:
  - **USB playback device** → corresponds to the **audio input to the processor**.
  - **USB capture device** → corresponds to the **audio output from the processor**.

### About USB Detection

- Before connecting the USB port, ensure that both the **console and PC are properly grounded** through three-terminal power plugs.

<Danger>
  Check with a multimeter (25V AC scale) between the PC chassis and console chassis.\
  Reading should be 0V. Otherwise, the USB input of the processor or computer could be damaged.
</Danger>

- Avoid changing USB cables between ports, as Windows may reassign device order.

## HD Mode (High Definition)

**HD mode** is intended for audio applications that do not use the FM stereo encoding stage (MPX).

- Fully digital stations (HD Radio and streaming).
- Sound reinforcement applications (small rooms, auditoriums, shopping centers).

**When switching to HD mode:**

- FM pre-emphasis network is disabled (and therefore the de-emphasis on audio outputs).
- A **fast-action limiter** is enabled on the outputs.
- **MPX** outputs are disabled.

### Enabling HD Mode

To change the operating mode, you need to access the internal **micro-switches** by removing the top cover of the unit.

- All switches **ON** = FM Mode
- All switches **OFF** = HD Mode

The status is indicated on the front panel through the **"FM"** LED:

- Lit = FM
- Off = HD

<Info>
  From factory, the unit comes configured in **FM mode**.
