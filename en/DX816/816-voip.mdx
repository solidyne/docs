## PC Connection

The DX series is designed to work with any communication software running on the computer, from video calling applications like Zoom or Google Meets, to SIP line reception software like Linphone.

The telecommunications channel allows sending a **differentiated return** (mix-minus) to the computer via USB-2, where the computer's own audio (USB-2 playback) is not mixed in, avoiding feedback loops.

The computer can be added in conference with the lines managed by the Telecommunications channel.

<Note>
  All communication software usually has internal cancellation mechanisms, but these systems frequently decouple causing echoes and audio artifacts. A mix-minus send is necessary to achieve reliable communications.
</Note>

<Danger>
  ****USB-2 is not operational if USB-1 is not connected to an active port.****\
  If USB-1 and USB-2 go to **two different PCs**, USB-2 will **not** work if the **USB-1** PC is **turned off**.\
  (Usually USB-1 is the 24/7 On-Air PC).
</Danger>

## Basic Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Microphones">
    Assign microphone channels to **PGM** and **REC**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="USB-2 Channel">
    Assign to **PGM** and **remove from REC**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Telco Channel">
    Set PGM-REC selection to **PGM**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Computer">
    Configure the application with **USB-2** audio device as input/output (microphone and playback).
  </Step>
  <Step title="ON AIR">
    The application audio enters the console through the USB-2 Channel and goes on air with microphone return (via REC).

    <Note>
      The application may be handling a single communication or a multi-participant chat. This does not affect console operation.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Conference with Phone Lines and Mobile (Vox-IP)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Microphones">
    Assign microphone channels to **PGM** and **REC**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="USB-2 Channel">
    Assign to **PGM** and **remove from REC**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Telco Channel">
    Set PGM-REC selection to **PGM.**\
    **Activate the VOX-IP button.** The phone lines/mobile return is sent to PGM-2 via **REC** (you'll see it on the **REC** VU).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Conference">
    Raise the Telco fader to add phones on air; all become **interconnected**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Danger>
  In the **return to the computer (REC)** do not assign **music beds**; only **MICs**.\
  The priority/AGC systems of communication applications may **attenuate** the remote voice if there is local audio (background music).
</Danger>
