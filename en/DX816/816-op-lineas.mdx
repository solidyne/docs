### Description

The **DX** line features **four stereo line channels**. Each channel has dual inputs, switchable from the front panel [2].

- **Channels LIN-1 and LIN-2**:
  - Balanced stereo input (**RJ45** connector).
  - Unbalanced stereo input (**RCA** connector).
- **Channels USB-1 and USB-2**:
  - Direct computer connection (equivalent to two external interfaces).
  - Provide **PGM** and **REC** signal routing to the computer.

1. **Gain control.** Adjusts the input gain. For LIN-1 and LIN-2 channels, gain adjustment affects both A/B inputs. On USB channels, gain only affects the analog input. \
   It should be adjusted to maintain the signal around **0 VU** with the fader operating in the **-10 to -20 dB zone**.

<Note>
  Digital level on USB channel is adjusted from Windows<sup>©</sup>.
</Note>

2. **A/B switching.** Toggles between main and auxiliary input.
3. **BUS.** Assignment to PGM (transmission) and REC mixing buses.
4. **CUE.** Activates pre-fader listening.
5. **Working zone.** This area indicates the correct working position for nominal signal level and proper input gain adjustment. \
   Gain should be adjusted so the attenuator works above -30 dB. The **OVL (7)** indication shows overload, meaning excessive input gain.
6. **Main attenuator (fader):** Adjusts the signal level in the mix.

### On-air Operation

To send the signal on-air:

1. Assign the channel to **PGM**.
2. Raise the attenuator.

   The correct level is achieved when peaks reach **0 VU**.
