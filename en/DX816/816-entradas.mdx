## Line inputs

The DX816/822 consoles feature different types of inputs, combined across the various console channels:

- **2 BAL-LINE**: balanced inputs.
- **4 AUX LINE**: unbalanced inputs.
  - **2 RCA** on LINE channels, switchable from the front panel.
  - **2 miniplug** on USB channels, with **automatic switching**: when inserting a TRS plug, USB audio is muted.

<Info>
  Unbalanced line inputs have a nominal level of **-10 dBV** over **10 KΩ**.

  The gain adjustment is shared for both (main/auxiliary). It may need readjustment depending on the connected equipment.
</Info>

### Balanced input connections

Balanced inputs use shielded **RJ45** connectors and require shielded category 5 multicore cable. You can purchase the **MNGDX822** pre-assembled cable kit, which includes the necessary cables for connection.

## Microphone inputs

The microphone inputs are electronically balanced and use standard **XLR connectors**.

- The rear panel features 5 XLR connectors.
- Inputs **MIC-4** and **MIC-5** share the preamplifier with **MIC-2** and **MIC-3**, respectively. Channel 2 and Channel 3 can handle two microphones each:
  - Channel 2 ⟶ Inputs MIC-2 and MIC-4
  - Channel 3 ⟶ Inputs MIC-3 and MIC-5

<Warning>
  When using two microphones on the same channel, they must be of the **same brand and model** to ensure signal homogeneity.
</Warning>

### 48V Phantom Power

The **48V** button on the module's front activates floating phantom power for **all microphones**. On the DX822 model, a second switch toggles power for inputs MIC-6 through MIC-10.

<Info>
  Dynamic microphones can handle 48V phantom power, so it's possible to mix dynamic and condenser microphones without risk.
