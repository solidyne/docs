## Telephone Line Connection

The hybrid channel handles **two landlines** and **one cell phone** connected via Bluetooth.

The console's rear panel has **four RJ11 connectors**:

- Two telephone lines (to connect to public network or PBX).
- Two associated telephone sets (labeled "SET"), typically used by production to handle calls.

<Warning>
  Lines are protected against overvoltage (up to 2,000 V) through internal varistors.\
  However, it is essential to install **external gas discharge protectors** connected to a 2m ground rod for public networks. **Equipment warranty does not cover lightning damage**.
</Warning>

### Null Adjustment

This adjustment applies only to **landlines**. It is performed once during installation.\
Null rejection prevents transmitted signal from returning mixed with the interviewee's voice, improving local speaker quality.

**Procedure:**

1. Assign the Telecommunications Channel to the **REC** output (to avoid adjusting on-air).
2. Establish a call and ask the interviewee to speak.
3. Adjust the call level with Channel 8 fader until the REC VUmeter reaches the white zone.
4. Activate a microphone channel (on REC) and ask someone to speak from the Studio.
5. While listening to the local voice on REC, turn the **NULL** control in both directions to find the optimal point, achieved when the local signal mixing through the hybrid is minimal.
6. This adjustment depends on the telephone line. If the telephone line changes, repeat the adjustment.

## Pairing a Mobile Phone

Any cell phone with **Bluetooth** can be paired with the DX816/822.\
Maximum distance is 5 m, though keeping the device nearby is recommended (never on top of the console).

The phone registers the console's unique ID code once. Subsequently, connection is automatic when Bluetooth is activated on both devices.

<Warning>
  The Bluetooth module receives power from **USB-1 or USB-2** channels.\
  If neither is connected to a PC, use an **external USB power supply** (standard charger) with the supplied cable.
</Warning>

### **Pairing Procedure:**

1. **On the console:** verify the **CELL PHONE [3]** LED button is off.
2. If Bluetooth is on (LED flashing blue), turn it off by holding the **Bluetooth [2]** button until flashing stops.
3. **On the console,** activate "search" mode (only accessible when Bluetooth is off). Press and <u>hold</u> the BLUETOOTH button for about 10 seconds. While pressing, you'll notice slow blue flashing initially, then rapid <u>alternating</u> blue and red flashing (see mode C in table), indicating DX816/822 entered "search" mode for phone discovery.
4. **On the phone:** Enable Bluetooth and search for devices.
5. When the phone finds the console's Bluetooth, it displays as **Solidyne BTM641**.
6. Connect the phone to the **Solidyne BTM641** device.
7. The console's Bluetooth device is now registered in the phone; no need to repeat unless **Solidyne BTM641 is unpaired (deleted) from the phone**.
8. On the console, the **CELL PHONE** button shows slow blue flashing (mode A) indicating connection to the phone.

### Bluetooth Volume Adjustment

<Danger>
  Adjustment must be done during an active Bluetooth call.\
  Phone volume is independent from Bluetooth link volume.\
  Adjusting without an active call only changes the phone's internal speaker.
</Danger>

- Bluetooth volume is stored in the phone.
- Setting to **maximum** is recommended for best signal-to-noise ratio.

---

### Turning Off Bluetooth

To turn off, hold the **BLUETOOTH** button until the **CELL PHONE** LED stops flashing.

---

### Reconnecting a Paired Device

1. **On the console:** activate Bluetooth with the **BLUETOOTH** button until the **CELL PHONE** LED flashes blue (approx. 5 secs).
2. **On the phone:** enable Bluetooth. When connection appears, the phone is ready to operate. When making or receiving calls, audio routes to the console.

<Note>
  On some phones, reconnection isn't automatic and manually selecting the **Solidyne BTM641** device from a list is required.
</Note>

## External Hybrid

DX consoles include an **External Hybrid** connector that handles program and hybrid return through a 6.35mm (¼") TRS jack.

<img
  src="/images/816/816-HibExt.bmp"
  alt="816 Hib Ext Bm"
  title="816 Hib Ext Bm"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"77%" }}
/>

- **Output (Tip)**: Microphone and program return to line. This signal is a PGM copy minus telephone line audio (**MIX-MINUS**). Connect to the external hybrid's **line return input**.
- **Input (Ring)**: Signal from external hybrid to console. Sums to PGM bus but not to MIX-MINUS. Should connect to external telephone hybrid output.

Return audio passes through the same circuit as the internal hybrid. The **Channel 8** main fader operates as with internal lines, allowing routing to air or CUE based on position.
