## Control Room Monitoring

The **CONTROL** outputs feature **1/8" (mini-jack) female TRS** connectors for speakers and headphones. The speaker output operates at a nominal level of **0 dBu**, designed for connecting active monitors.\
The console's MONITOR section contains the signal assignment and level controls for both speakers and headphones.

<Note>
  The **Control Speaker** output automatically mutes when **Talk-back** is activated, preventing feedback with the talkback microphone.
</Note>

## Studio Monitoring

The console provides monitoring signals to the Studio through **STUDIO MONITOR OUT**, with RJ45 connector. Connection is made using **STP RJ45-RJ45 (pin-to-pin)** cable to the optional **Solidyne Studiobox HD3/HD5** monitoring boxes.

<Danger>
  This output **must not be connected** with RJ45 cables used for audio outputs.\
  It is not compatible with the **StudioHub** standard.
</Danger>

Features:

- Studio speakers **automatically mute** when microphones are opened.
- The headphone signal **never mutes**. They always receive the signal assigned at the console and the talkback audio.

For more details, see section **Studiobox HD3 / HD5 Monitoring Modules**.

## Single Room Monitoring

When the console is used in an integrated studio or single room setup, it is recommended to connect the speakers to the **STUDIO MONITOR** output.

<Warning>
  The CONTROL speaker output **does not mute when microphones are turned on**, so there is a risk of feedback if microphones and speakers are in the same room.
</Warning>

## Connection without optional Studiobox

The console comes with a "Y" **adapter cable** (RJ45 to dual TRS jack) for connecting generic headphone distributors and powered speakers.

- The **STUDIO MONITOR** output delivers fixed-level signals.
- Without Studiobox, speaker level is adjusted from the monitors' own controls.
- A headphone distributor/amplifier with dual input can be used to control speaker volume from the desk.
  - Input A → headphone signal.
  - Input B → speaker signal.

The speaker volume control is assigned to input B. This way, a single unit controls both Studio headphones and monitors.
