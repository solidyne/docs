## Introduction

Several main areas can be distinguished on the console:

- Input channels
- Telecommunications channel
- Studio monitoring and talkback assignment
- Preview listening (**CUE**)
- Level meters

Different audio sources (microphones, computers, audio interfaces, links, telephone lines, etc.) enter the console through the **input channels**, which amplify them.

The console mixes all signals to generate two main outputs:

- **PGM**: signal sent to the audio processor and then to the transmitter or streaming
- **REC**: independent or auxiliary recording signal

The operator controls the level of each signal with the **main faders**.\
Using the assignment buttons (**PGM / REC**), signals are routed to the corresponding outputs.

The **CUE** buttons allow previewing these signals before putting them on air.

- Line channels are sent on-air by opening the fader
- Microphone channels also require pressing the **MASTER MIC** button
- **BAL-1** and **BAL-2** line channels feature dual input (balanced and unbalanced), selectable from the front panel

## Microphone Inputs

- **DX816**: features 3 microphone faders, but MIC-2 and MIC-3 inputs include a second connector (MIC-2b and MIC-3b) sharing the same preamp. This way, channels 2 and 3 can handle two microphones simultaneously, allowing up to **5 microphones**.
- **DX822**: the same applies to MIC-4 and MIC-5 channels (with twin inputs MIC-4b and MIC-5b). It allows a total of **10 microphones on 6 faders**.

<Warning>
  It is recommended that microphones on twin inputs are of the **same brand and model** to maintain signal uniformity.
</Warning>

- All microphone inputs support switchable **48V phantom power** in groups
- On DX816, **equalization** is global for all microphones
- On DX822, a second equalizer acts on MIC-4, MIC-5 and MIC-6 (and their twin inputs)

**Compression** affects only microphone channels. Its action depends on the program level. The **gain reduction indicator** shows the compressor's work.\
If two microphones share a channel, the compressor matches their levels, smoothing differences due to proximity or voice intensity.

<Note>
  Dynamic microphones are designed to handle **48V phantom power**, so they can be mixed with condenser microphones without risk.
</Note>

## Line Inputs and Digital Modules

- **BAL-1 and BAL-2** channels handle balanced and auxiliary unbalanced inputs, selectable from the front panel
- **USB** modules manage two stereo signals via USB
- The USB connection sends **PGM (USB-1)** and **REC (USB-2)** signals to the computer
- In models with **AoIP** option, up to two Ethernet modules can be installed for streaming transmission/reception
  - Available signals: PGM and REC
  - Each AoIP module also receives a stream, which is assigned to a line channel

## Indicators

The console meter bridge includes:

- **LED VU meters** for program and recording (peak-average level)
- **Microphone compressor indicator**
