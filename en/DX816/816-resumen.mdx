## Input Channels

### Microphones

The DX series of the Broadcast Classic line includes the models: **DX816** and **DX822**.

- **DX816** features 5 microphone inputs. Using dual preamps and audio compression allows handling 5 MIC channels from 3 faders. Channel 2 simultaneously controls MIC-2 and 2b inputs, while Channel 3 controls MIC-3 and 3b.
- **DX822** offers 10 microphone inputs, distributed across 6 faders. Channels with dual inputs are MIC-2, MIC-3, MIC-5, and MIC-6.

All inputs support **48V phantom power**.

It features a global 4-band equalizer (dual in DX822) for microphones. Its use is oriented towards general equalization corrections for microphone or room characteristics.

The microphone mix is processed by dynamic **compression/limiting**, which is essential when using two microphones on the same fader, to compensate for level differences between microphones or variations in voice intensity.

### Line Inputs

The four line channels allow connection of up to 6 audio sources.

- **LIN-1 and LIN-2**: balanced and unbalanced stereo inputs, switchable from the panel.
- They accept incoming streaming signals via Ethernet in consoles with optional AoIP modules (DX816/AoIP and DX822/AoIP models).

**USB-1 and USB-2** channels provide direct computer connection.

The **Telecom** channel handles two landline telephone lines (2-wire) and a Bluetooth-connected mobile phone. All three can be on-air in conference mode, with simplified operation thanks to internal automation. \
Additionally, the console provides send and return for external hybrid connection.

In models with **AoIP option**, up to two audio streams can be received via Ethernet, which are added to the PGM and REC mixes.

## Outputs

**Analog**\
The DX816/822 consoles offer two main outputs. Line, microphone, and telecommunications channels have two assignable sends: **PGM (program)** and **REC (recording)**.

**Digital**\
It features two digital sends via USB, allowing direct computer connection. \
The operating system recognizes DX816/822 interfaces as USB recording devices, transmitting PGM (USB-1) and REC (USB-2) signals.

**Streaming (AoIP, optional)**\
With up to two AoIP expansion modules, the console can send PGM and REC as RTP streams over Ethernet, plus receive up to two remote audio streams. This enables direct linking with transmitter sites, remote studios, or external journalists via Internet.

**AES-3 (optional)**\
With an additional module, the console offers AES digital outputs for PGM and REC. It can be used in parallel with an AoIP module.

## Monitoring

The monitoring section distributes signals to the Studio and Control Room speakers and headphones.

Includes:

- Preview listening (CUE, PFL).
- Studio talkback.
- Master microphone button.

**Studio Monitoring**: allows selection of ON-AIR, PGM, REC or CUE. The signal is distributed to speakers and headphones through optional **Solidyne HD3 and HD5** modules.

**Control Room Monitoring**: independent level adjustments for headphones and speakers, with AIR (external tuner input), PGM, REC or CUE options.

**Preview listening (CUE)**: pre-fader signal is heard in headphones or control speakers. It can also be sent to Studio monitors. The talkback microphone also works in combination with CUE for private dialogue with a call on hold.

**ON-AIR LIGHT (Tally Light):** 12V output. Activated by the Master microphone button. Additionally, it incorporates a large LED on the chassis that acts as On-Air Light.

## GPIO

The DX816/822 can trigger external devices when opening a fader, on channels:

- MIC-1, MIC-2, MIC-3 (plus MIC-4, MIC-5 and MIC-6 in DX822).
- USB-1 and USB-2.

These GPIO can control:

- Audio management computers.
- Digital processors (e.g., Solidyne 462dsp, 562dsp, 542 APC).
- Special devices (e.g., Solidyne SmartCam video switcher).

In AoIP-enabled models, the console also sends "MIC On-Air" signal over network, allowing the audio processor to automatically switch to a preset adjusted for human voice.

## ETM-VCA Faders

DX816/822 consoles use **"feather touch"** conductive ceramic faders, with over 20 years of life expectancy under normal conditions.

Features:

- Robust construction, sliding on steel-silver bars with Teflon bushings.
- ETM-VCA Control (Electrometric Voltage Controlled Amplifier): audio signals don't pass through the faders, but through low-noise, highly stable amplifiers. Faders only send control signals.

**ETM-VCA system advantages:**

- Completely eliminates noise from fader wear.
- Extends lifespan and eliminates maintenance.
- Outstanding stereo correlation (less than 0.1 dB error).
- Uses conductive ceramic faders with 10 million operations warranty.
