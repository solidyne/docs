## USB Ports Connection

The **USB-1** and **USB-2** ports allow direct computer connection using standard **USB A/B cables**. They support 1.1, 2.0 or 3.0 ports.

Make sure to use **high-quality cables**. Poor cables can cause USB connection drops during audio playback or intermittent failures.

It is recommended to place the computer close to the console, using 2-3 meter cables. If extensions are used, do not exceed 4 meters.

<Warning>
  Before connecting USB to the computer, ensure both devices have **effective grounding** through their three-pin plugs. **Quick check:**

  - Using a multimeter set to 25V AC, measure between the PC and console chassis. Reading should be **zero volts**.
  - Only then connect the USB plug.
  - Without proper grounding, the USB port may be damaged.
</Warning>

- USB ports are compatible with **Windows© and Linux**.
- If both are connected to the same computer, **connect USB-1 first**.
- To use a single channel, always connect **USB-1**.

  <Danger>
    The **USB-2 port only works if USB-1 is connected and active**.
  </Danger>
- When connecting two different computers, note that USB-2 will not work when the PC connected to USB-1 is powered off. Therefore, USB-1 is assigned to the on-air PC, which remains active 24/7.

## Windows<sup>©</sup> Installation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Connection in Windows is Plug&Play. The system automatically recognizes and installs the drivers. The port appears as **"USB 1 playback device"** and **"USB 1 recording device"**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    On the VU tower, the **Digital IN/Out** indicator will show "4" (recognized stereo input + output).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    When connecting the second channel (USB-2), the indicator changes to "8" and the PC shows a second playback and recording device.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    The ports can be connected to the same computer or to two different machines.
  </Step>
</Steps>
