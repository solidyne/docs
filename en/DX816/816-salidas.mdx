### Program output

The main output is called **PROGRAM (PGM)**. It is typically the signal sent to air and is available in several formats:

- **RJ45**: delivers **balanced PGM signal**.\
  Always use this connector to send analog signal to the audio processor or STL link.

  <Tip>
    [Pin diagrams and adapter cables for cable assembly](/es/diagramas/RJ45-pinout).
  </Tip>
  <Info>
    Solidyne **362HD** and **542APC** processors include analog inputs with RJ45 connectors. Connection is made using a **shielded STP RJ45-RJ45** Ethernet cable.
  </Info>
- **TRS female**: delivers unbalanced stereo PGM signal.
- **USB (USB-1 Channel)**: PGM signal is sent to the connected computer, typically used for Internet streaming.
- **AoIP (optional)**: on consoles with /AoIP module, PGM is available in multiple formats (PCM, MP3) over Ethernet connection.

### REC output (auxiliary)

The **recording (REC)** output is also offered in several formats:

- Balanced on **RJ45** connector.
- Unbalanced stereo on **TRS**.
- Digital USB through **USB-2 Channel**.
- Streaming over **Ethernet** on models with dual /AoIP module.

The nominal output level of the console is **+4 dBu @ 0VU**.\
When using balanced outputs in unbalanced mode, the level drops 6 dB, therefore **0VU = -2 dBu**.

<Danger>
  **Do not use mono (TS) plugs** to connect stereo TRS outputs.
</Danger>

<Note>
  If you connect equipment with **-10 dBV** input level to the console output, the level may be excessive and cause saturation. In these cases, a **fixed attenuator (resistive divider)** must be used to reduce the level.
</Note>

### Decoded streaming audio

The **Audio Out to Bal Line 1** output is only available on consoles with **/AoIP** option.\
It delivers a balanced analog signal with the **decoded audio from incoming streaming** and is used to re-inject the decoded audio to an analog line input.
