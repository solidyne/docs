## Hybrid Channel: Operations

The TELCO channel concentrates telephone communications. It includes a telephone hybrid with **2 landlines**, **1 Bluetooth link** to connect a mobile phone and can add **VoIP communication** from a computer via **USB-2**. All three (or four, counting VoIP) can be **in conference**.

Additionally, more lines can be added using an external hybrid. These lines do not consume extra console channels, as they connect directly to the TELCO channel, which acts as a MASTER control for putting external lines on air.

### Panel Controls

1. **PGM-REC.** Assigns the TELCO channel to PGM or REC outputs. REC enables call recording (by assigning microphones to REC) while other content plays on air.

    <Warning>
      Assigning TELCO to both buses simultaneously is not supported. \
      If there is no hybrid audio on air, verify that **PGM-REC** is set to **PGM**.
    </Warning>

2. **VOX-IP.** Sends **telephone line return** to **USB-2** port (REC bus). This configures a mix-minus for communications applications running on the computer, which receives return from active TELCO sources (landlines, Bluetooth mobile, external hybrid)
3. **Bluetooth Channel.** On-air button for the Bluetooth device.
4. **Bluetooth Control.** Activation and mode button for the Bluetooth interface.
5. **Hybrid Channels.** Telephone hybrid control buttons for landlines.
6. **NULL.** Adjusts rejection for landlines.
7. **CUE Level.** Adjusts the level of the call in the preview circuit. This is an installation setting, usually not modified during normal operation.
8. **TALK.** Enables the Talk-Back microphone to talk to telephone lines. It is latching type; press again to turn off.
9. The **OVL** indication shows the start of the correct working zone. Gain adjustment for landlines is automatic. For Bluetooth it will depend on the phone's level setting, which should be adjusted so the attenuator works above -30 dB.
10. **Main Fader:** Adjusts call levels in the mix.
11. **HOLD-CUE:** Automatic system that changes the call mode according to fader position.
    - **a)** If fader is closed, the call is routed to CUE circuit. The operator can talk to the line by pressing TALK [8] and listen through CUE channel.
    - **b)** If fader is in the dotted HOLD zone, the call is put on HOLD. PGM audio (or REC depending on assignment) is sent to the line but the line is not on air.
    - **c)** Above the HOLD zone, the call goes on air at the level determined by the fader.
