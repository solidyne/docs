## Audio stream generated from another console

The AoIP module can be configured to **receive RTP streaming** generated from another Solidyne console with streaming support (e.g.: **D612**, **2600** series, **Unidex** series, **ADA102** coder/link).\
The encoding device must have the **same firmware (STL)**.

From factory, the console comes in **CODER (Studio Encoder)** mode. To receive, it must be configured as **DECODER**.

### Reception configuration (Decoder)

1. Access the IP module from a web browser (see [IP Module Access](/es/DX816/816-stl).
2. In the top menu, click **Location**.
3. **Change** the mode to **→ Transmitter Decoder**.
   - Factory default: **Studio Encoder**, generates unidirectional streaming.
   - As **Decoder**, default values are adopted (only modify IP and ports).
4. Go to **Configuration → Streaming**.
5. In **Port**, enter the port used in the encoder (the transmitting device).
6. In **URL**, leave **0.0.0.0**.
7. Press **Apply** to confirm.

### Buffer adjustment (RTP delay)

The **input buffer** (expressed in milliseconds) prevents audio interruptions when bandwidth is insufficient:

| Audio Format         | Recommended Buffer                             |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| PCM                  | 40-80 ms                                     |
| Compressed (e.g. MP3) | >80 ms (depends on codec and decoding)       |

<Tip>
  Higher buffer → fewer cuts, but greater **audio delay**.\
  The optimal value depends on **bandwidth** and **format** used.
</Tip>

The audio format is always defined by the **transmitting device**.

### Decoded audio connection

- Audio received via Ethernet is sent to **balanced inputs** through external cable (RJ45 to RJ45, provided).
- Connection: **AoIP Output Option → BAL-1 or BAL-2**.
- In DX822 with two AoIP modules: derived output to both inputs (BAL-1 and BAL-2) using special "Y" cable (supplied).

## Reception using a computer

It's possible to receive transmission from a DX/AoIP on a computer with RTP-compatible software.\
Recommended: **VLC Player** (free – [videolan.org/vlc](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/)).

**Format configuration in VLC:**

- **PCM16 @ 44.1 kHz**, or
- **MP3** in any of its modes.

Other formats may require a **SDP** payload file.

**VLC procedure:**

- Menu: **Media → Open Network Location**.
- In URL field enter:

  `[protocol]://[source_IP]:[port]`

For example:

RTP://0.0.0.0:3030

- `RTP` → protocol.
- `0.0.0.0` → any incoming IP.
- `3030` → used port.

<Note>
  Some VLC versions accept: `RTP://@:3030`
