- With **2 modules**: they send **PGM and REC**.

**AoIP Applications:**

- **Transmitter plant link** (STL) using dedicated receivers (Solidyne **ADA102**,

  Solidyne **542 APC /AoIP** processors).

### AoIP Module Power Supply

AoIP modules are powered through **USB** connections. They require at least one USB to be connected to a **powered on** computer.

<Warning>
  If the console is not connected to a USB computer, or if it is turned off, the IP service **will not be available**.
</Warning>

<Note>
  In the absence of a computer, it is possible to connect a **standard USB power supply (5V)** to power the AoIP modules.
