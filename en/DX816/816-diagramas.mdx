## Power supply

The DX816/822 works with external power supply. A **90-240V switching power supply** is included, which operates with any power grid, even in areas with large voltage variations. It delivers regulated **28 VDC**.

<Warning>
  It is recommended to always use the **original power supply provided by Solidyne**.
</Warning>

The **DC IN** power input is located on the rear panel, with a 1.8mm positive pin tubular connector.

## RJ45 Connectors

With the advent of **Audio over IP (AoIP)**, various manufacturers have adopted the use of **RJ45 connectors** and shielded multipair cable to replace traditional audio connectors.

- A single RJ45 connector contains **two balanced lines**, reducing the rear panel size and number of connectors.
- Using **structured cable** facilitates installation between distant equipment anywhere in the world, thanks to the wide availability of components and assembly tools used in data networks.
- Soldering is eliminated, simplifying and speeding up wiring.

At the multipair cable end, connection to audio devices (microphones, speakers, interfaces) continues using **standard audio connectors**.\
For this purpose, RJ45 sections terminate in balanced connectors appropriate for the destination equipment.

The balanced inputs of the **Solidyne DX816/822** console use **RJ45 connectors** and are wired with **shielded CAT-5 (STP)** multipair cable.

The **Solidyne MNGX816** connection kit includes all necessary cables for balanced inputs and outputs with RJ45, ensuring reliability and preventing connection errors.

<Note>
  Solidyne RJ45 audio connections are **compatible with the StudioHub standard** ([www.studiohub.com](http://www.studiohub.com)).
