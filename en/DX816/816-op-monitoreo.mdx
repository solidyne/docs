### **Studio Monitor**

- Offers four signal sources: CUE, PGM, REC and ON-AIR [4].
- The console sends fixed-level signals to both headphones and speakers.
- A **headphone distribution system** is required for Studio level control and distribution, such as the optional Solidyne HD3 and HD5 modules.

<Info>
  See wiring in Installation ⟶ [Monitoring](/es/DX816/816-monitoreo)
</Info>

### **Control Monitor**

- Headphones [3] and speakers [1] levels have independent controls.
- Control Room monitoring signal is selected through buttons [5]:
  - **PGM**: signal sent to air.
  - **REC**: auxiliary REC bus signal.
  - **ON-AIR**: signal from an external tuner, recommended for air monitoring.

<Note>
  Adjust monitor speakers volume for comfortable listening with **SPEAKERS** control at center position.
</Note>

<Info>
  If the Studio-Transmitter link or audio processor produces audible delay, it is recommended to process the **ON-AIR** monitoring signal with a zero-latency processor connected directly to a console PGM output.

## Preview listening (CUE)

Each channel has a **CUE** button that allows monitoring the pre-fader signal (off-air). When multiple CUE buttons are active, signals are summed.

CUE signal can be sent to:

- Control Room monitor speakers: press **MIX** button [2].
- Control Room headphones. This send is fixed. CUE is mixed with the signal assigned by monitor selection.
- Studio monitoring. Available as a signal source in STUDIO MONITOR.

CUE volume is controlled only by the **CUE** knob [6], both for headphones and speakers.

<Warning>
  If **CUE [6]** knob is closed, CUE signal won't be heard even if headphones and speakers knobs are open.\
  However, if **SPEAKERS [1]** and **HEADPHONES [3]** are closed, CUE will still sound if CUE knob is open.
</Warning>

Other features:

- CUE send is **monaural**.
- To listen to CUE in isolation:
  - Lower **SPEAKERS** or **HEADPHONES** level as appropriate.
  - Release PGM, REC and ON-AIR buttons.

<Tip>
  We recommend monitoring air signal at moderate volume and CUE at higher level for clear distinction.
</Tip>

## Studio Talk-Back

The talkback channel allows the operator to communicate with talent in the Studio.

- Press the **TALK-BACK** button.
- Program audio in Control Room speakers is interrupted to prevent feedback.
- The operator is heard in the Studio's **left channel**.
- The **right channel** maintains the air signal for reference by announcers and journalists.
- It's also possible to activate **CUE** on the microphone channel to dialogue with the announcer.

<Note>
  The talkback microphone level is factory calibrated.\
  Adjust using the **LEVEL** preset only if strictly necessary.
