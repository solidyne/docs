## On-Air Light (Tally Light)

The **Tally Light** output delivers **12 VDC / 150 mA** when the **Master Microphone Button** is enabled.\
It can connect up to **two Solidyne LA100 signaling modules**.

Additionally, the console includes a **built-in on-air light in the cabinet**.

<Danger>
  The **Tally Light** output automatically shuts off if the load exceeds **150 mA**.
</Danger>

## GPIO

The minijacks labeled **GPIO** are general purpose outputs (**GPO**, _General Purpose Output_), which allow controlling external devices when certain console channels are enabled.

- On **DX816**: signals are generated by microphone channels **MIC-1, MIC-2, MIC-3** and lines **USB-1** and **USB-2**.
- On **DX822**: in addition to the above, **MIC-4, MIC-5 and MIC-6** also have GPO.

<Note>
  The control outputs are **open collector** type, functioning as a switch:

  - In inactive state → high impedance.
  - When a channel is enabled → output connects to ground.
</Note>

**Electrical specifications:**

- Maximum: **+24 V - 0.1 A**.

**Connectors:**

- **3.5 mm TRS jack** type, located on the rear panel.
- On DX816: "MIC 1&2", "MIC-3" and "LINE USB 6&7".
- On DX822: "MIC 4&5" and "MIC-6" are added.
