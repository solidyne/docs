## Console Operational Check

Basic procedure to verify connections:

1. Use a signal source (microphone, player, etc.).
   - On channels 4 or 5, select the correct input (BAL/LIN).
   - Common error: no signal due to incorrect input assignment.
2. Press the **CUE** button on the input channel.
3. Select **CUE** as monitoring source and adjust CUE level.
   - Audio should be heard in headphones (and monitors if assigned).

**To send the signal on-air:**

1. Press **PGM** on the channel to route it to the main output.
2. Raise the channel fader to desired level.
   - The signal will go on-air and show on the program VU meters.

<Warning>
  Gain must be adjusted on each channel (except USB) using the gain presets on the panel, so the normal working position of the main fader is **-15 dB (gray zone)**.
</Warning>

## Program Recording

DX series consoles feature two stereo output buses:

- **PGM (Program)**: signal sent on-air.
- **REC (Recording)**: auxiliary signal, typically used for recording.

Each channel can be assigned to **PGM** or **REC** using assignment buttons, allowing recording while broadcasting another signal.

### USB Recording

PGM and REC signals are available on the computer via **USB**.

In **<sup>Windows©</sup>**:

- **USB Recording Device 1** → corresponds to **USB-1**, PGM signal.
- **USB Recording Device 2** → corresponds to **USB-2**, REC signal.

On the **computer**:

- Configure the recording application to use the appropriate device.

On the **console**:

- In monitoring, assign **REC** to Control or Studio speakers if talent needs to hear the recording.
- Remove channels to be recorded from **PGM** and assign to **REC** (e.g., microphones).

  → These channels will NOT go on-air.
- Station remains on-air with another channel (e.g., Line-1 on PGM).

**Level adjustment:**

- Check levels on console's REC VU meters and in software.
- Adjust from console using channel fader → **0 VU = -15 dBfs**.

<Danger>
  **USB-1 and USB-2 recording devices have no software input level control**.\
  Adjustment is always done on the console.
</Danger>

**Monitoring:**

- Talent can monitor through headphones or speakers.
- To play back recordings: assign the corresponding PC channel to **REC**.

<Warning>
  Avoid feedback loops on the PC. Mute possible returns from USB-2 (REC) input in the recording software (or Windows)
</Warning>

When finished, return controls to their original position.

### Recording Phone Lines

The **TELCO** channel can be assigned to either output using the **PGM/REC** button.

Example: recording a phone interview while music plays on-air.

- Assign the **hybrid** and a **microphone** to the **REC** output.
- Proceed with communication as in _Hybrid Channel_.
- Assign monitoring to **REC** to hear the conversation.
