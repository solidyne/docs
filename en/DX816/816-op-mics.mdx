## General Features

The microphone modules of the DX series have **3 channels**, although they allow connecting up to **5 microphones** on their rear panel.

⟶ The **MIC-2** and **MIC-3** inputs allow connecting a second microphone (2b and 3b).

⟶ Faders 2 and 3 control two microphones simultaneously when inputs 2b and/or 3b are connected.

The **DX822** model has two 3-microphone modules. It handles **6 microphone faders** and supports up to **10 microphones** (4 dual inputs).

1. **Gain preset.** Must be adjusted so the fader works above the overload mark **OVL (-30 dB)**.

   ⟶ Working below this level amplifies unnecessarily, causing peak clipping. ⟶ Ideally, work with the fader within the **optimal zone (-10 to -20 dB)**.
2. **Phantom power 48V.** Enables/disables for all inputs in the module.

<Note>
  Dynamic microphones can be safely connected to inputs with phantom 48V, as their internal transformer decouples the DC voltage.
</Note>

3. **EQ**. Enables/disables equalization for all microphones in the module.
4. **EQ.** Gain controls for frequency bands.
5. **BUSES:** Assignment to output buses **PGM** and **REC**. Microphones are assigned together to PGM, REC or both. Assignment is post-EQ.
6. **CUE:** sends the pre-fader signal to the preview circuit. Activated on each channel.
7. **Working zone:** This area indicates the correct working position for nominal signal level and proper input gain adjustment. \
   Gain should be adjusted so the fader works above -30 dB. The **OVL (9)** indication shows overload, meaning excessive input gain.
8. **Main fader**. Adjusts the signal level in the mix. Besides raising the faders, to enable the microphones you must press the MASTER MIC button located to the right of the faders.

## Equalization

The equalization is global and affects all microphone channels. The goal is to allow general EQ adjustments that respond to room acoustics characteristics, which are common to all microphones.

**EQ Features:**

- **Bands 1 and 4** (low/high): in **Shelving** mode, range ±15 dB.
- **Band 2**: Peak EQ. Centered at 160 Hz. Can soften the "popping" effect.
- **Band 3**: Centered at 6.3 kHz. Can soften "hissing" and sibilant sounds.

## Compression

The dynamic compressor reduces large level variations in microphones. \
The design avoids audible artifacts and simplifies operation. Simply raise the microphone fader levels until the VU meters reach the red zone.

- Acts on the mix of microphone channels.
- Cannot be disabled.
- Activates when signal exceeds **0 VU**.
- Below that level, the signal is <u>not affected</u>.
- Compression ratio: **10:1**, with fast attack and release times.
- The compressor will reduce gain by a value shown on the **MIC Compressor** meter.
- Compression values of **5 to 15 dB** are optimal when operating multiple microphones simultaneously.
