## Inputs and Outputs

**AUDIO IN (SEND TO LINES)**\
Unbalanced ¼" TS jack input. Receives the signal sent to telephone lines and Bluetooth mobile devices.\
Connects to a _mix-minus_ output from the console: a mix of local sources (microphones, other communications) that does not contain the HL240-VQ audio.

The send level is adjusted using the **INPUT LEVEL** control on the front panel. Depending on the configuration, it can also be adjusted from the console.

**AUDIO OUT (MIX)**\
Balanced male XLR output. Delivers the audio mix from the lines, adjusted using the **BLUETOOTH** and **PHONE LINE** rotary controls.

**DIRECT OUT PH-1 and BLT-1**\
Unbalanced ¼" jack outputs. Deliver Line-1 and Bluetooth-1 signals at fixed level (pre-fader).\
Each output connects to a console line input, allowing independent handling from the main mix.

**HEADPHONES**\
Stereo headphone output. Delivers the same signal as the AUDIO OUT.

## Connection to consoles with external hybrid send/return

If the on-air console has a special connector for external hybrid send and return, connection is made using a "Y" split cable (insert type).

The **Solidyne 2300, 2600, DX816/822 and D612** series provide this connection through a ¼" TRS jack. The external hybrid is operated from dedicated controls on the console, without occupying line channels.

The following table describes the "External Hybrid" cable pinout supported by these Solidyne consoles:

**"Y" Cable Wiring for "External Hybrid" ↔ HL240-VQ**

| "External Hybrid" Jack on Console | AUDIO IN (TS ¼") | AUDIO OUT (MIX) - Female XLR |
|----------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| **Tip** (mix-minus send)         | Tip             | —                          |
| **Ring** (return)                | —               | pin 2                      |
| **Sleeve** (ground)              | Sleeve          | pin 1 (pin 3 n/c)          |

<Note>
  For other Solidyne console models or other manufacturers, check the manual to identify external hybrid send/return connections.

## Connection to consoles without hybrid facilities

For live sound or recording consoles that generally lack external hybrid send/return connections, the HL240-VQ connects to a line channel and an auxiliary bus or mix output.

![Hl240 Diagrama Consola Generica Pn](/images/hl240/hl240-diagrama-consola-generica.png)

- The HL240-VQ **AUDIO OUT** sends the mix of lines (landlines and Bluetooth). Connect this output to a balanced line input on the console.
- The **AUDIO IN (SEND TO LINES)** receives audio from the console and sends it to the lines. Connect this input to an auxiliary output (AUX, REC, FX, etc.), different from the main output (LR).

On the console, the channel receiving the HL240-VQ signal **must not be assigned to the auxiliary mix** that feeds the HL240, as this would create a feedback loop.

<Danger>
  Never send the main mix (LR output) to the HL240-VQ, as this will create a feedback loop when that channel is summed to air.
</Danger>

<Note>
  Some consoles (example: Solidyne UNIDEX series) allow configuring outputs as _mix-minus_. This avoids using a dedicated auxiliary bus.

## Hybrid operation

The hybrid circuit is responsible for separating the incoming and outgoing signals from the telephone line. The hybrid rejection adjustment allows you to minimize the return of the signal sent to the line, which appears mixed with the incoming signal.

### Hybrid rejection adjustment

1. Connect a telephone line to the HL240-VQ.
2. Make a call and establish communication.
3. Send a signal to the telephone line (voice or music).
4. While listening to the return signal from the hybrid output, adjust the **HYBRID NULL** control to minimize the return signal.

<Note>
  The hybrid rejection adjustment is independent for each line. When changing lines, readjust the rejection.
</Note>

<Warning>
  The hybrid rejection depends on the impedance of the telephone line, which varies according to distance, installation conditions, and other factors. The rejection achieved may vary between different telephone lines.
</Warning>

### Bluetooth operation

The HL240-VQ has a Bluetooth interface that allows connecting mobile phones to make calls or play music. The Bluetooth interface appears on mobile devices as "HL240-VQ".

To pair a mobile device:

1. Enable Bluetooth on the mobile device.
2. Press and hold the **PAIR** button on the HL240-VQ for 3 seconds.
3. On the mobile device, select "HL240-VQ" from the list of available devices.
4. The connection is confirmed when the Bluetooth LED stops blinking.

<Note>
  The HL240-VQ remembers the last 3 paired devices. When turned on, it will automatically connect to the last device used if it is within range.
