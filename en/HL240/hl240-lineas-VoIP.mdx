Digital IP telephone lines (Voice over IP or VoIP) can be connected to the analog RJ11 inputs using VoIP to telephone pair adapters. These devices are also known as **Analog Telephone Adapter** (ATA)

Another alternative is to use a VoIP phone with Bluetooth hands-free support. In this case, we will use the "Hands-free" mode to pair the phone with a Bluetooth channel of the Telco-Mixer HL240-VQ.
