## Mounting Recommendations

The Solidyne HL240-VQ Telco-Mixer is designed for installation in a standard 483 mm (19") rack. It requires one rack unit (1U) of free space.

It can also be placed on a desk, for which four self-adhesive rubber feet are provided.

<Tip>
  When rack mounting the unit, always use flat-head screws with flexible washers (plastic or rubber).\
  Tighten the lower screws first, then the upper ones, preventing the unit's weight from creating leverage stress on the upper rack angles against the frame.
</Tip>

### Bluetooth Antennas

The HL240-VQ has two Bluetooth antennas on the rear panel, so an open rack is recommended. Keep the antennas separated from other equipment sharing the rack.

Paired Bluetooth phones should be kept close to the unit, avoiding placing them directly on top of it.

## Power Supply

The HL240-VQ connects directly to **110 or 220V** mains power using the supplied power cord (Interlock AC-0106).

A **voltage selector switch** for manual voltage selection is located on the rear panel. This must be set to the correct position as appropriate.

The **power switch** and **main fuse (1A)** are located in the same area.

<Danger>
  Before connecting the unit to mains power, verify that the **110/220V selector switch** is in the correct position.
