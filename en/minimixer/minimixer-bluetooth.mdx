## Bluetooth Pairing

Any Bluetooth-enabled phone can be paired with the **MiniMixer**.\
The mobile device can be placed up to 3 meters away, although keeping it nearby is recommended, avoiding direct contact with the console.

When pairing a phone with the MiniMixer, a link is created between both devices.\
The mobile device stores the console's identification code (ID), and this operation is only required once per phone.\
Once the console and mobile device are paired, simply enable Bluetooth on both devices and select the corresponding device on the phone.

The procedure is similar to other Bluetooth devices, like speakers or hands-free kits.

### Pairing Procedure

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Bluetooth status on the console">
    Make sure the **BLT** button is off.

    - When Bluetooth is on, the LED blinks slowly (one flash every 2 seconds).
    - If it's on, press and hold the **BLT** button until the LED turns off completely.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate pairing mode on the console">
    With Bluetooth off, press and hold the **BLT** button for ~10 seconds.\
    The LED will start blinking rapidly, indicating that pairing mode is active and the console is ready to be detected by the mobile device.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search for devices on the phone">
    On the mobile device, enable Bluetooth and search for new devices.\
    This procedure varies by brand and model, consult the phone's manual if necessary.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Solidyne BTM641">
    The MiniMixer will appear as **Solidyne BTM641**.

    - If the phone requests a passcode, enter `0000`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm pairing">
    Once accepted, the console's identification code is stored in the phone.\
    The **BLT** button LED will change to slow blinking (every 2 seconds), indicating that Bluetooth is active.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  - This operation is not necessary while using the same phone.
  - To pair a new mobile device, repeat the procedure from the beginning.
  - It is not possible to pair two phones simultaneously.
</Note>

### Device Name

The default name **Solidyne BTM641** can be changed from the phone's Bluetooth settings menu.

## Reconnecting a Previously Paired Device

1. Enable Bluetooth on the console by pressing **BLT** until the LED turns on (approximately 5 seconds). The LED will remain slowly blinking.
2. Enable Bluetooth on the phone. When the connection is confirmed, incoming and outgoing calls will automatically route through the console.

<Info>
  On some phones, reconnection is not automatic. In these cases, manually select the **Solidyne BTM641** device from the phone's Bluetooth device list.
</Info>

## Volume Adjustment

<Warning>
  It is essential to set the phone's Bluetooth volume to **maximum** to ensure good reception and the best signal-to-noise ratio.
</Warning>

- Adjustment should be made during an actual Bluetooth call.
- The phone's speaker volume is independent of the Bluetooth volume.
- If the level is changed with Bluetooth disconnected, only the speaker volume is modified, not the wireless link volume.
- The Bluetooth level is stored in the phone's memory.
- If using another phone, repeat the procedure to set the volume to maximum.

## Turning Off Bluetooth

## Troubleshooting

### The Phone Does Not Connect

1. Verify that Bluetooth is enabled on both devices.
2. Check if the phone is already paired with another Bluetooth device.
3. If the phone was previously paired but does not connect:
   - Delete the pairing from the phone's Bluetooth settings
   - Turn off Bluetooth on the console
   - Repeat the pairing procedure

### Poor Audio Quality

1. Ensure the phone's Bluetooth volume is set to maximum.
2. Check that the phone is within range (maximum 10 meters with clear line of sight).
3. Verify there are no sources of interference nearby:
   - WiFi routers
   - Other Bluetooth devices
   - Microwave ovens
   - Metal obstacles

### Connection Drops

1. Check the distance between phone and console.
2. Verify battery level on the phone.
3. Ensure there are no physical obstructions.
4. Move away from potential interference sources.
