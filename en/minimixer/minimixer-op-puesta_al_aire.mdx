## Microphones

The MiniMixer allows connecting up to **4 dynamic microphones**.\
**MIC 3** and **MIC 4** inputs share the same fader.

- The **MASTER MIC** button enables all microphones on air and activates the **Tally Light** output.
- The microphone mix is internally compressed.
  - The compressor acts when the signal reaches **0 VU**.
  - It is important that the **MIC 3+4** channel reaches 0 VU so the compressor can compensate for level differences between voices.
- The compressor action is displayed on the **MIC COMP** indicator.

---

## Lines

- The **USB/LINE IN** fader controls the **USB** digital input when the computer is connected.
- If USB is not connected, this fader controls the **LINE IN** signal.
- When USB is in use, the LINE IN input can also be used as an alternative input from the **PHONE** zone controls, which allow switching between **PHONE** and **LINE IN**.
  - This allows mixing on air: 4 microphones + 2 stereo lines + Bluetooth.

To send **USB/LINE IN** on air:

- Raise the fader directly.
- The correct working level is achieved when peaks reach **0 VU**.

The **USB/LINE IN** signal can also be previewed in CUE with the fader closed by pressing the **CUE** button located above it.

<Info>
  The **USB** port generates a program signal feed to the computer.\
  This audio stream is used for **Internet streaming**.

## Monitoring

The headphone control in the **CUE MONITOR** zone sets the level for all four headphone outputs.

- For individual volume control on each headphone, use headphones with built-in level control or connect an external headphone distributor to any of the outputs.
- When a signal is sent to **CUE**, it is distributed to all headphone outputs.
- The **PGM** button in the **CUE MONITOR** zone allows muting the program signal in headphones to hear only the signals in **CUE**.

### Monitor speakers output

- Headphone output #1 can function as a monitor speakers output, with automatic muting when the Tally Light output is connected.
- When microphones are enabled, the Tally Light activation automatically mutes headphone output #1, preventing feedback between speakers and microphones.
- Audio remains available on the other headphone outputs.

### Talk

- The **TALK** button momentarily interrupts the headphone signal and sends the voice from the built-in internal microphone in the console.
- This allows the operator to communicate directly with all headphones, even if team members are far away.
- This avoids visual signals or the need to remove headphones (which are receiving program signal) to be able to talk.
