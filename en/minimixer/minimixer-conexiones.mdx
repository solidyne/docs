Below are the connectors and functions of the MiniMixer rear panel:

![Minimixer Rear Panel Pn](/images/minimixer/minimixer-panel_trasero.png)

 1. **POWER SUPPLY**
    - Barrel connector (pin+ / 2 mm).
    - External switching power supply 90/240V – 50/60 Hz – 12V/1A.
    - **Use only the original power supply provided by Solidyne.**
    - The MiniMixer has no power switch: it remains active while the power supply is connected.
 2. **TALLY LIGHT (On-air light)**
    - Barrel connector (pin + / 2.5 mm).
    - Provides 12 VDC with maximum load of 200 mA.
    - When connecting the on-air light, headphone output #1 is automatically muted whenever microphones go on-air.
 3. **USB AUDIO**
    - USB A/B port for digital stereo input/output to computer.
    - The operating system (Windows 7/10 or higher) detects two devices:
      - **USB Playback Device** (stereo input to console).
      - **USB Recording Device** (stereo output from console with PGM signal).
    - Cable length should not exceed 4 meters.
    - Always ensure proper computer grounding to prevent damage.
 4. **MICROPHONES**
    - Four balanced XLR inputs for dynamic microphones.
    - **MIC-3** and **MIC-4** inputs share the same fader.
    - Using microphones of the same model on these two inputs is recommended for better level matching.
 5. **HEADPHONES**
    - Four outputs on 1/8" TRS connector (minijack).
    - A single control adjusts the overall headphone level (CUE MONITOR section).
    - **Headphone #1** output can be used for powered monitors.
    - When tally light is connected, this output automatically mutes when microphones open.
 6. **LANDLINE TELEPHONE (POTS)**
    - RJ11 connector for 2-wire line.
    - Includes **NULL** adjustment preset for hybrid rejection calibration (see adjustment procedure).
    - The line can connect directly to public network or PBX (in the latter case rejection quality may decrease).
    - Internal surge protection via varistors.
    - Additional external protection with gas discharge tubes and fuses is recommended.

    <Warning>
      Damage from atmospheric discharges is not covered by warranty. Surge protection is recommended in storm-prone areas.
    </Warning>
 7. **STEREO LINE**
    - Unbalanced 1/4" TRS stereo input.
 8. **PROGRAM INSERT**
    - 1/4" TRS stereo input/output.
    - Allows inserting an external processor in the PGM signal sent to USB.
    - Useful for applying multiband processing or effects before streaming.
 9. **PROGRAM OUTPUT**
    - 1/4" TRS stereo output.
    - Contains the mix of microphones, USB, auxiliary line and telephone lines.
10. **MICROPHONE MIX OUTPUT (REC OUT)**
    - 1/8" stereo minijack output.
    - Delivers exclusively the microphone mix (post compressor).
    - Allows voice recording even when console is broadcasting other content.
11. **SMART-CAM (optional)**
    - Mini USB connector.
    - Sends microphone status to PC for automated camera switching.
    - Used with **Audicom Video** and streaming service.
