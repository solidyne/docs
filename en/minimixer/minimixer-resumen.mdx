The **Solidyne MiniMixer** is a compact, robust and elegant console.\
Despite its small size, it offers great connectivity flexibility, including USB audio and Bluetooth link for mobile phones.

MiniMixer is designed for integrated studios where the announcer and operator work in the same room. It's also ideal for self-operated scenarios where the host manages the console.

- An internal compressor acts on microphone inputs to compensate for level differences between voices.

### Line Inputs

  - One analog (TRS).
  - One digital via USB port, allowing direct computer connection.

### Phone Lines

- Handles up to two lines:
  - One conventional landline (2-wire).

## Monitoring and CUE

- Up to 4 headphones can be connected on the rear panel.
- If using headphones with built-in volume control, the headphone distributor can be bypassed.
- **Tally Light**: when the On Air light is connected, headphone output #1 becomes a monitor output, muting when microphones are on air to prevent feedback.
- **CUE/Preview**: allows communication with lines and monitoring signals before going on air.
- Built-in **talk-back** microphone for private communication with each phone line or headphones.

## Outputs

- Generates two mixes:
  - **Program (PGM)**: sent to PGM outputs and USB (for streaming).
  - **Microphone output**: allows recording the microphone mix while console is on air.
- **Insert**: insertion point to connect an external processor on the PGM signal sent via USB.
