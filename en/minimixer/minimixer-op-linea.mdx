### Receiving a call

<Steps>
  <Step title="Call detection">
    When a call comes in, the **HOLD** button flashes with the ring cadence, regardless of the **PHONE/LINE IN** button position.

  <Step title="Check CUE mode">
    Ensure the **PGM/CUE** button is in **CUE** position (released) before taking the line.

    <Danger>

    </Danger>
