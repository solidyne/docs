## General Description

Different audio sources —microphones, computer and telephone lines— enter the console through the input channels.\
The MiniMixer combines all signals to generate the main signal called **Program (PGM)**.

Each audio source is controlled by its respective faders.

The console functions are grouped into different zones:

1. **Telecommunications**: controls for managing landline and Bluetooth mobile phone.
2. **Intercom**: enables communication with telephone lines and headphones using the internal microphone.
3. **DTMF Keypad**: enables direct dialing on landline from the console.
4. **Faders**: control microphone and line signal levels.
5. **Level Meters**: display PGM level and microphone compressor action.
6. **Connections**: indicate connector locations on the rear panel.

## Telephone Lines

The MiniMixer includes a hybrid channel to handle both landline and Bluetooth mobile phone.\
Its operation is simple and error-proof, thanks to safety logic and automatic circuits.
