The **MiniMixer** allows recording the microphone mix to the computer while simultaneously broadcasting content from the same PC.

The **MIC REC** output delivers the microphone mix (post-compressor), available even when microphone channels are turned off.

### Basic Connection

- The computer must have an analog line input (common in desktop or mini-tower PCs).
- The "Y" splitter cable connects the three TRS in parallel.
  - Can be purchased with the **Solidyne MNG-Mini** cable kit (see Cables and Accessories section).
  - Any standard "Y" splitter TRS 1/8" → 2 × TRS 1/8" female can be used, with TRS-TRS cables to the LINE IN input of the console and computer.
- The recording software must be configured to work with the PC's internal line input and output (or other audio interface connected for microphone recording).
- In the reference diagram, speakers appear connected directly to the computer output.

### Alternative Connection with ASIO Interface

If you have an audio interface with **ASIO** support:

- The ASIO interface output can connect directly to MiniMixer's **LINE IN**.
- Software with ASIO support must be used (e.g.: **Reaper**, **Vegas**, **Audition**).
- During recording, internal input monitoring is activated on the software channel, while microphones are heard through MiniMixer's **LINE IN**.
- During playback, recorded material plays directly to the console.

<Warning>
  Built-in PC sound cards usually have latencies of ~0.5 seconds, making it impossible to monitor your own voice in real-time.\
  In these cases, connection must be done using the basic scheme explained above.
</Warning>

### Recording Procedure

<Steps>
  <Step title="Play programming from computer">
    The PC plays **Audicom-MX** programming (or other software) entering via USB to MiniMixer (fader #4).\
    The console's VU meter should show peaks at **0 VU** to maintain correct streaming level.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure microphone status">
    The **MASTER MIC** button must be **off**, as microphones should not go on air.\
    The on-air light remains off.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor transmission or recording">
    - To monitor streaming transmission in headphones: press **PGM** button in **CUE MONITOR** zone.
    - For recording: keep this button released to avoid hearing the transmission.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send microphones to recording output">
    Raise the **MIC-1**, **MIC-2** and **MIC 3+4** faders.\
    Adjust levels watching the **MIC COMP** indicator, which should show two LEDs lit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor during recording">
    Use headphones connected to the console.

    - If there are speakers in **Headphone-1**, they must be muted to prevent feedback, since automatic muting doesn't activate when the on-air light is off.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Listen to microphone mix in headphones">
    In the **PHONE** zone:

    - Set **PHONE/LINE IN** to **LINE IN** position.
    - Set **CUE/PGM** to **CUE** position.
    - Set level control to maximum.\
      Final volume adjustment is done with the **CUE MONITOR** control.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Play the recording">
    Play the file from the computer and listen through speakers or headphones connected to it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Playback monitoring**

  If the computer monitors through speakers:

  - It's advisable to fully close the level in the **PHONE** zone, or lower the microphone faders, to prevent audio leakage from speakers into the headphones.
</Tip>

### Recording Software

- **Audacity** (installed with Audicom-MX): open-source multitrack editor ([www.audacityteam.org](http://www.audacityteam.org)).
  - Allows recording voice on one track and then adding music and effects on additional tracks.
- **HDCorder**: editor included in Audicom-MX for simple recordings and edits.

Refer to **Audicom** documentation for more details.
