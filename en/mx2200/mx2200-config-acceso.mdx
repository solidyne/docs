## Configuration

All Internet streaming options and modes can be accessed in two ways:

1. **From the onboard display**: using the rotary control (**encoder**).
2. **Remotely (recommended)**: using a computer and web browser.

## Web Access

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect the console to the network">
    - **Ethernet (recommended)** through RJ45 port.
    - Or via **Wi-Fi antenna**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect the computer">
    The computer must be on the **same network as the MX2200** and preferably using the same access method (Ethernet or Wi-Fi).

    <Note>
      Some Wi-Fi networks do not allow access to devices connected via cable (LAN).
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open browser and enter IP">
    Enter the MX2200's **IP address** in the browser (corresponding to the method used: Ethernet or Wi-Fi).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get IP from the console">
    Turn the **CONTROL (encoder)** knob and access the **SETUP** screen.\
    The first three items show the connection status and assigned IP for Ethernet, Wi-Fi and Modem.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get IP from computer">
    The IP can also be found by running the **Solidyne Multi-Discovery** tool on the PC.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
     **Solidyne Multi-Discovery**

     If physical access to the console is not available, you can [**download the Multi-Discovery tool**](/es/mx2200/mx2200-discovery) that detects Solidyne devices connected to the network.
