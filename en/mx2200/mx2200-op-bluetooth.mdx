## Key Concepts

In operation, it's essential to distinguish three different actions:

- **Enable/disable Bluetooth on mobile**\
  Turn Bluetooth on or off on the phone. Does not involve pairing or connecting to a device.
- **Pair/Link the mobile with a device**\
  Also called _pairing_. The mobile **registers** an external device (headphones, car hands-free, or MX2200's Bluetooth channel). This is done **only once** per device.\
  A device can be **unpaired**, meaning deleted from the list of Bluetooth devices linked to the mobile. To use it again, you'll need to pair it again.
- **Connect/Disconnect a previously paired device**\
  The mobile **connects** to one of the previously paired devices. This is different from pairing. With Bluetooth enabled on the mobile, connection/disconnection is done from the **list of paired devices**.

### BLT LED States

The **BLT** button illuminates in amber with different flashing patterns according to the Bluetooth status:

| Mode  | Status                                   | LED Indication                              | Meaning                                                                                                                                           |
| :---: | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A** | **Mobile connected**                      | Brief ON (1 s) \+ long OFF (2 s)           | Mobile is connected to MX2200, **no active call**                                                                                                 |
| **B** | **Mobile not connected / Call in progress** | Slow ON (2 s) \+ short OFF (1 s)          | - Bluetooth on but **no mobile connected**<br />- Or mobile has an **active call**<br />- When a mobile connects, status changes to **A**         |
| **C** | **_Search mode (Pairing)_**               | Fast flashing                               | Allows phone to find and pair with **MX2200**                                                                                                     |
| **D** | **Incoming call**                         | Steady ON                                   | Indicates an incoming call                                                                                                                        |
| —     | **Off**                                   | No illumination                             | Bluetooth off                                                                                                                                     |

### Operation Notes

- **Mode A** confirms the mobile is properly linked, ready to use as audio source or backup link.
- **Mode B** can indicate two situations: no mobile connected yet, or an active call.
- **Mode C** should only be used when **pairing** a new phone.
- **Mode D** acts as clear notification of incoming call, with steady illumination.

<Note>
  Never confuse **pairing (mode C)** with **connecting/disconnecting (mode A/B)**. Pairing is done only once per phone, while connection/disconnection happens each time of use.
</Note>

The image shows an example of an Android mobile with a call. Switching between Bluetooth and Speaker allows transferring the call to MX2200 (Bluetooth) or speaking from the phone (Speaker).

  Interface may vary by system/version: some Android show a **Headset/Speaker** button, others a menu with **options**. Check your phone's manual.

## Pairing mobile with MX2200

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare the console">
    Ensure Bluetooth is **off** on the MX2200.\
    If the **BLT** button flashes amber with **slow** intermittence (≈1 flash every 2 s), Bluetooth is **on**. Press and hold **BLT** until the LED turns completely **off**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter pairing mode">
    With Bluetooth off, press and hold **BLT** ~**8 s**.\
    You'll first see **slow** flashes (mode B) then **fast** flashing (mode C). **Release** the button when it changes to fast flashing: console enters **pairing** mode and is ready to be discovered.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search from mobile">
    On the phone, **enable Bluetooth** and search for **new devices** (procedure varies by make/model).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the device">
    The device will appear as **Solidyne BTM641**. Select it to **pair** and then to **connect** if the system asks twice.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation and name">
    After pairing, **BLT** remains with **slow** flash (Bluetooth **active**).\
    On mobile you can **rename** "Solidyne BTM641" from device settings if desired.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Multiple mobiles and distance">
    You can **pair multiple** phones with MX2200, but **only one** can be **connected** at a time.\
    Typical range: **up to 3 m**. Keep mobile **nearby**, but **never** placed directly on the MX2200.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Re-connecting a previously paired mobile

The mobile can **disconnect** from MX2200 in various situations. The following table shows what happens and how to reconnect:

| Situation                                      | What happens to the call                                                                        | How to return to MX2200                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bluetooth turned off on mobile**             | Call usually **transfers to phone** (behavior may vary by make/model)                           | **Turn Bluetooth back on**; reconnection may be **automatic** or select **Solidyne BTM641** from list          |
| **Mobile disconnected from Bluetooth device**   | Call exits Bluetooth and goes to **phone**                                                      | On mobile **reconnect to Bluetooth** Solidyne BTM641 to return it to console                                   |
| **"Speaker" activated on mobile**               | Call exits "hands-free" mode (Bluetooth) and goes to **phone**                                  | Switch to **"Headset/Bluetooth"** on mobile to return to console                                               |
| **Bluetooth channel turned off on MX2200**     | Bluetooth link cuts off. Call usually transfers to phone.                                       | **Turn on BLT** and **reconnect** from mobile                                                                  |

<Note>
  Reconnection **won't be possible** if the **same** Bluetooth channel on MX2200 was paired with **another phone** and that second phone is **currently connected**.
</Note>

## Volume Adjustment

<Warning>
  On the **mobile**, set **Bluetooth volume to maximum** to ensure good reception and best **signal-to-noise ratio**.
</Warning>

<Info>
  Make the adjustment **during a Bluetooth call**. If you change volume **without** an active call, it modifies the phone's **internal speaker** volume and **not** Bluetooth volume.
</Info>

- Bluetooth level remains **stored in the mobile**.
- If changing phones, repeat adjustment to set Bluetooth volume to **maximum**.

## Turning off Bluetooth on console

To **turn off** Bluetooth on MX2200, press and hold **BLT** until LED **turns off**.\
If operating on battery and not using Bluetooth, keep it **off** to **save power**.
