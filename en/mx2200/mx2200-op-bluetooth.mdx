## Key Concepts

In operation, it's essential to distinguish between three different actions:

- **Activate/deactivate Bluetooth on the mobile device**\
  Turn Bluetooth on or off on the phone. This doesn't involve pairing or connecting to a device.
- **Link/Pair the mobile device with a device**\
  Also called _pairing_. The mobile device **registers** an external device (headphones, car hands-free system, or the MX2200's Bluetooth channel). This is done **only once** per device. \
  A device can be **unpaired**, meaning it's deleted from the list of Bluetooth devices linked to the mobile. To use it again, you'll need to pair again.
- **Connect/Disconnect an already paired device**\
  The mobile device **connects** to one of the previously paired devices. This is different from pairing. With Bluetooth activated on the mobile, you connect or disconnect from the **list of paired devices**.

### BLT LED States

The **BLT** button illuminates in amber with different flashing patterns according to the Bluetooth status:

| Mode  | Status                                   | LED Indication                           | Meaning                                                                                                                                                |
| :---: | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **A** | **Mobile connected**                     | Brief on (1 s) \+ long off (2 s)         | The mobile is connected to the MX2200, **with no active call**                                                                                         |
| **B** | **Mobile not connected / Call in progress** | Slow on (2 s) \+ brief off (1 s)         | - Bluetooth turned on but **no mobile connected**<br />- Or the mobile has an **active call**<br />- When a mobile connects, the status changes to **A** |
| **C** | **_Search mode (Pairing)_**              | Rapid flashing                           | Allows the phone to find and pair with **MX2200**                                                                                                      |
| **D** | **Incoming call**                        | Steady on                                | Indicates there's an incoming call                                                                                                                     |
| —     | **Off**                                  | No illumination                          | Bluetooth off                                                                                                                                          |

### Operation Notes

- **Mode A** confirms the mobile is correctly linked, ready to be used as an audio source or backup link.
- **Mode B** can indicate two situations: either no mobile connected yet, or there's an active call.
- **Mode C** should only be used when **pairing** a new phone.
- **Mode D** acts as a clear notification of an incoming call, with steady illumination.

<Note>
  Never confuse **pairing (mode C)** with **connecting/disconnecting (mode A/B)**. Pairing is performed only once for each phone, while connection/disconnection occurs each time you use it.
</Note>

The image shows an example of an Android mobile with an active call. Switching between Bluetooth and Speaker allows transferring the call to the MX2200 (Bluetooth) or speaking directly from the phone (Speaker).

<Note>
  The interface may vary by system/version: some Android phones show a **Headset/Speaker** button, others a menu with **options**. Check your phone's manual.
</Note>

## Pairing the Mobile with MX2200

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare the console">
    Make sure Bluetooth is **turned off** on the MX2200.\
    If the **BLT** button flashes amber with a **slow** pattern (≈1 flash every 2 s), Bluetooth is **on**. Press and hold **BLT** until the LED **turns off** completely.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter pairing mode">
    With Bluetooth off, press and hold **BLT** for ~**8 s**.\
    First, you'll see **slow** flashes (mode B) and then a **rapid** flashing (mode C). **Release** the button when it changes to rapid flashing: the console is in **pairing** mode and ready to be discovered.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search from the mobile">
    On the phone, **activate Bluetooth** and search for **new devices** (procedure varies by brand/model).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the device">
    The device will appear as **Solidyne BTM641**. Select it to **pair** and then to **connect** if the system prompts twice.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation and name">
    After pairing, **BLT** remains with a **slow** flash (Bluetooth **active**).\
    On the mobile, you can **rename** "Solidyne BTM641" from the device settings if desired.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Multiple mobiles and distance">
    You can **pair multiple** phones with the MX2200, but **only one** can be **connected** at a time.\
    Typical range: **up to 3 m**. Keep the mobile **nearby**, but **never** placed directly on the MX2200.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Re-connecting an already paired mobile

The mobile can **disconnect** from the MX2200 in various situations. The following table indicates what happens and how to reconnect:

| Situation                                      | What happens to the call                                                                           | How to return to MX2200                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bluetooth is turned off on the mobile**      | Typically the call **transfers to the phone** (behavior may vary by brand/model)                   | **Turn Bluetooth on** again; reconnection may be **automatic** or select **Solidyne BTM641** from the list        |
| **Mobile disconnects from the Bluetooth device** | The call exits Bluetooth and transfers to the **phone**                                            | On the mobile, **reconnect to Bluetooth** Solidyne BTM641 to return it to the console                            |
| **"Speaker" is activated on the mobile**       | The call exits "hands-free" mode (Bluetooth) and transfers to the **phone**                        | Switch to **"Headset/Bluetooth"** on the mobile to return to the console                                          |
| **Bluetooth channel is turned off on MX2200**  | The Bluetooth link is cut. Typically the call transfers to the phone.                              | **Turn on BLT** and **reconnect** from the mobile                                                                 |

<Note>
  Reconnection **will not be possible** if the **same** Bluetooth channel on the MX2200 was paired with **another phone** and that second phone is **currently connected**.
</Note>

## Volume Adjustment

<Warning>
  On the **mobile**, set the **Bluetooth volume to maximum** to ensure good reception and the best **signal-to-noise ratio**.
</Warning>

<Info>
  Make the adjustment **during a Bluetooth call**. If you change the volume **without** an active call, you modify the **speaker volume** of the phone internally and **not** the Bluetooth volume.
</Info>

- The Bluetooth level is **stored in the mobile**.
- If you change phones, repeat the adjustment to set the Bluetooth volume to **maximum**.

## Turning off Bluetooth on the console

To **turn off** Bluetooth on the MX2200, press and hold **BLT** until the LED **turns off**.\
If operating on battery and not using Bluetooth, keep it **turned off** to **save power**.

## Broadcasting via Bluetooth

<Steps>
  <Step title="Console preparation">
    In the **CELL PHONE** section, keep the **LEVEL control closed** and **CUE/PGM in CUE** (released).
