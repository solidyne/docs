When the unit broadcasts through Internet, landline (POTS) or mobile phone can be used as backup transmission method.\
Or if transmission is done using a Bluetooth mobile phone, a landline can be used simultaneously as mobile backup transmission.

The configuration of the lines to operate as links is:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Line as link">
    It is also possible to use a phone line as **main transmission channel**.

    - In **PGM** position, studio return is removed from CUE monitoring and added to program mix.
    - The **mic TALK** is not sent to the studio.
    - It is recommended to use the line in **PGM** position, to prevent the talkback microphone from accidentally going on air.
    - If studio return monitoring is not needed: keep the **PGM knob closed**.
    - To listen to return: open the **PGM** knob → studio signal is heard in all headphones monitoring PGM mix.
    - Signal sending to the lines is in **mix-minus** mode: signal coming from studio is removed from the send, avoiding feedback.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Line as backup">
    While MX2200 broadcasts through **Internet**, landline or mobile phone can be used as **backup method**.

    - When the line is in **CUE** position, studio return is sent only to headphone monitoring.

    <Info>
      Once the call is established, studios always receive the **PGM** mix, regardless of whether the line is in **CUE** or **PGM** mode.
    </Info>
    - If **TALK** is pressed on that line, the talkback microphone is sent to the studio through that line.
    - This condition allows the MX2200 operator to talk privately with the Studio while the console broadcasts over Internet.
  </Tab>
