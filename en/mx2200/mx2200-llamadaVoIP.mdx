The **SIP CALL** option enables **bidirectional communication or link** through Internet, with **minimal delay**.\
It is equivalent to a conventional VoIP call (similar to Skype or WhatsApp).

It is used when:

- Immediate interaction with studios is required.
- Simple connection is needed on networks beyond your control (public Internet, Wi-Fi at various locations).

Communication is established without complex configurations at either end, even under **limited bandwidth** conditions.

- When configured at low bitrate, it ensures continuity even with restricted Internet.
- When configured at maximum quality, audio is equivalent to direct studio sound.

Operation is simple: a pre-loaded directory shows available contacts. The user selects one and makes the call. At the studio, the operator receives the communication on a compatible computer or equipment. It's also possible to **receive incoming calls from the studios**.

    - A **ring tone plays in CUE**.

    <Warning>
      To receive incoming calls on MX2200, it's necessary to **disable call encryption** in the communications software used.

      In Linphone: _Preferences → Calls and Chat → Encryption = None_.\
      If encryption is active, the console won't be able to take the call.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Studio Return">
    - The MX2200 sends the **Program (PGM)** signal to the Studio.
    - The Studio returns **mix-minus**: floor signal without the console's own signal.
    - The console mixes program signal plus studio return in CUE.
    - The user can remove the PGM signal from headphones to hear only the **Studio return** (see _Monitoring_ section).
  </Tab>

## Receiving MX2200 at the Studios

The SIP call can be received with any compatible system:

- Hardware **DECODERs**.
- **VoIP Software** on PC.

The user can freely choose the SIP service:

- Paid services are recommended for stability.
- Free options are also available, notably [Linphone](https://www.linphone.org).

The **SIP account/contact** assigned to the studio (the contact the console calls) is configured in the decoder.
