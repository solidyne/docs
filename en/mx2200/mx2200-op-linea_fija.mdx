Step by step procedure for receiving or making calls on the console

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="RECEIVING CALLS">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Identify incoming call">
        When receiving a call, the **HOLD** button flashes in sync with the ring, regardless of the **PHONE/LINE IN** button position.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Check channel in CUE">
        Ensure **PGM/CUE** is in **CUE** position (released) before answering the line.

        <Warning>
          If **PGM/CUE** is in **PGM** when answering, the call will be **directly added to the output mix** at the level set by the **LEVEL** knob.
        </Warning>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Select input">
        The **PHONE/LINE IN** button must be in **PHONE** position (released) to hear the phone line audio and for the line to receive talkback.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Answer the call">
        Press **HOLD**. The caller will hear the **PGM** signal as talkback.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Adjust headphone level">
        Adjust using the line's **LEVEL** knob.\
        The master **CUE MONITOR** level also affects this.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Private conversation">
        Press the corresponding microphone **TALK** button.\
        While held, the caller stops hearing the program return and hears only the operator.\
        When released, the line returns to hearing the program signal.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Monitor without program">
        In the **CUE MONITOR** section, the **PGM** button allows removing program audio from headphones to hear only the phone line.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Put on air">
        Press **PGM/CUE**.\
        The mix level is adjusted with the **LEVEL** knob.\
        The caller can interact with all four active microphones on the console.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Hold the line">
        To take the call off air and put it on hold:

        - Turn the **LEVEL** knob to zero.
        - Press **CUE/PGM** to return to CUE.\
          The line remains on hold hearing the program signal.
      </Step>
      <Step title="End the call">
        Press **HOLD** to disconnect and release the line.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="MAKING CALLS">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Check channel in CUE">
        Confirm the **PGM/CUE** button is in **CUE** position (released).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Take the line">
        Press **HOLD**.\
        You will hear the dial tone in headphones.\
        Volume is adjusted with the **LEVEL** knob and master **CUE MONITOR** control.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Dial">
        Use the **console keypad**.\
        If you need to hang up and redial: release **HOLD** and press it again to retake the line.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Continue operation">
        Once the call is established, continue from the **Private conversation** step (see _Receiving Calls_ section, step 6).
