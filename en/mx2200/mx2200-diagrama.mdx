The diagram illustrates an operational scenario that shows all the capabilities of the **MX2200**.

## Program Mix

- **4 dynamic microphones** (two share the MIC 3\+4 fader).
- **1 mobile phone**:
  - Can be used with a Bluetooth microphone.
  - Can be Bluetooth-linked to a second **Solidyne MX2100** console to handle multiple microphones and headphones.
- **Notebook via USB**: plays audio directly through the console, allowing all content to be generated from the remote location.

## Broadcasting to the Studios

The **MX2200** accesses the Internet through:

- Wi-Fi connection
- Wired LAN connection
- 4G modem

**Studio Link:**

- Connection is established through full-duplex **SIP calls** with no audible delay.
- Call setup is immediate: the console dials and the studio answers (or vice versa).
- An Internet server (**Cloud Service**) initially connects both ends (1 and 2). Once established, the connection becomes a private **Internet Tunneling** between the console and the studio (3).
- In parallel with the SIP call, the **MX2200 CODEC** can transmit:
  - An RTP stream to an IP address
  - Another stream to a web server (Icecast/Shoutcast), with different quality settings
- As backup, you can use:
  - A **landline (POTS)**
  - The **Bluetooth mobile phone** (if not used for program mix)

## Studio Reception

The SIP call is received using a computer with third-party VoIP account management software. Free options are available, such as [Linphone](https://www.linphone.org/).

## Recording

The **MX2200** can record over **100 hours** of program in **MP3 @192 kbps** format to its internal memory.\
Recording can be activated simultaneously with transmission.
