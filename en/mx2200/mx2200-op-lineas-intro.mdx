## General Description

The **MX2200** handles:

- One conventional landline telephone (POTS).
- One mobile phone connected via **Bluetooth**.

The main function of both lines is to serve as a **backup link** for the Internet connection.\
They can also be used:

- As the main broadcast channel when Internet is not available.
- As an audio source to add a call to the broadcast.

---

## Using Lines "On Air"

- Participants (reporters or interviewees) can be added to the broadcast.
- This can be done with landline or Bluetooth mobile, even while the console is broadcasting via Internet.
- The line can interact privately with the console operator, and also with the studios when sent to program (PGM).
- The studio return signal (SIP) is injected into monitoring (CUE) and sent to both landline and Bluetooth.
- The SIP link return level is adjusted from the screen, in **SETUP → RX VOLUME**.

<Warning>
  **Warning!**\
  Conference between landline and Bluetooth mobile is **not supported**.\
  It is possible to put both lines on air, but they will not hear each other or be able to dialogue.
</Warning>

## Line as Studio Link

- Once the call is established, the studios always receive the **PGM mix** through the telephone line.
- In **CUE position**, the return signal sent by the Studio is heard only in monitoring. If the TALK button for that line is pressed, the talkback microphone is sent to the studios.
- In **PGM position**, the Studio return is removed from CUE and added to PGM.
- The line send is **mix-minus**: the Studio return is not added to the PGM being sent back, avoiding feedback.
- In PGM position, the talkback microphone is not sent to the studio.
- Therefore, when using the line as a link, it should always be set to **PGM**, preventing the TALK mic from accidentally going on air.
- The studio return (audio from the other end) can be heard in headphones by mixing PGM with the telephone line (verify that PGM monitoring is enabled in CUE).
- If return monitoring is not needed, keep the PGM knob closed.

1. **PHONE/LINE IN**
    - Switches between telephone line and stereo line input.
    - With Internet link it's possible to operate with 4 microphones and 2 audio sources (LINE IN and USB).
    - If a call comes in on landline, the **HOLD** button flashes. The operator can switch from LINE IN to PHONE and answer the call.

    <Warning>
      When there is no Internet and the link is made via Bluetooth, it is not possible to add either PHONE LINE or LINE IN, since **PHONE LINE is not added to the mix sent to Bluetooth**.\
      LINE IN can only be used from its own fader if there is no USB audio.
    </Warning>
