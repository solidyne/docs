A **multimedia web server** is a third-party service that receives the audio stream from the **MX2200** and forwards it through a public link accessible worldwide and simultaneously by multiple devices.

- Service plans are usually based on the **number of simultaneous users** allowed.
- Once access is configured on the console, usage is very simple: just ensure the MX2200 is connected to the Internet and start broadcasting.
- It is an ideal method when **mass signal distribution** is required.

<Warning>
  The **delay** in this type of transmission can vary between **5 and 30 seconds**, depending on the platform and connection. For this reason, it is recommended only when the signal is generated from the remote location **without real-time interaction** with the studios.
