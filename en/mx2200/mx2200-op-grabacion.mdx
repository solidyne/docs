## Recording Screen

The **MX2200** console allows you to make a **backup recording of the event** in stereo **MP3 format (16 bits / 48 kHz)**, widely supported by audio players and editors.

The RECORDING screen is accessed by rotating the encoder from the HOME screen. It allows you to **start/stop** recording and configure its parameters.

Navigation is similar to other screens: pressing the knob accesses internal navigation and, within each option, a click allows changing its value or state.

- **STATUS**\
  Allows you to **enable or stop** recording.\
  When stopped, the file is automatically generated with the content recorded up to that moment.
- **MAX TIME**\
  Defines the maximum recording time.
  - Prevents the operator from having to stop it manually.
  - Recording stops automatically when reaching the defined time.
  - Editing: value is entered using the console's numeric keypad (maximum **240 minutes / 4 hours**).
  - It's possible to **increase the time limit while recording is in progress**, without interrupting it.
- **BIT RATE**\
  Defines audio quality.
  - Range: **64 to 320 kbps**.
  - The higher the value, the better quality and larger file size.
  - At **192 kbps** approximately **100 hours** can be stored inside the console.

<Info>
  When recording is enabled, the main screen indicates the recording status and shows the **remaining available time**.

## Managing Recordings

Management (monitoring, playback, renaming, downloading and cleanup) is done **remotely** from a networked computer.

To access: enter the equipment's IP address followed by **/recording** in a browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Edge, etc.).

Example: `192.168.0.118/recording`

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect the console">
    Connect the console to the local network using the **Ethernet** port (recommended) or **Wi-Fi** antenna.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open browser">
    On a computer on the same network, open a browser and enter the MX2200's **IP address** with the `/recording` subpath.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get IP address">
    To find the assigned IP, rotate the **CONTROL (encoder)** knob and access the **SETUP** screen.\
    The first three items show the connection status and IP address for **Ethernet**, **Wi-Fi** and **4G Modem**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

- The **HTML5** interface includes a player to **forward, rewind and pause**.
- The list can be sorted by **name, date or size**.

  <Note>
    The displayed date corresponds to the **local time of the client computer**, not the console.
  </Note>
- Audio can be **downloaded** and will be saved to the browser's default downloads folder.
