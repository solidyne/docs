## Introduction

Broadcasting to the studio can be established in different ways:

1. **Digital audio via Internet**
   - SIP call (full-duplex with minimal delay).
   - RTP streaming (transmission only).
   - Shoutcast/Icecast server.
2. **Mobile phone call** (Bluetooth).
3. **Landline phone call** (POTS).

In practice, once the Internet broadcasting options are configured, the user only needs to **connect the MX2200 to the Internet** and start the desired transmission, without additional configuration.

Broadcasting methods can be combined, either to have a **backup** (e.g. SIP + mobile) or as a **complement** (RTP streaming + private telephone communication with the studio).

## Internet Connection

The MX2200 CODEC-MIXER can connect to the Internet in three ways. Only **one connection** can be active at a time, although it's possible to configure more than one so that if one fails, the console automatically reestablishes the connection through another route.

  <Tab title="Wi-Fi Connection">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Connect antenna">
        <img
          src="/images/mx2200/mx2200-antena.png"
          alt="Mx2200 Antena Pn"
          title="Mx2200 Antena Pn"
          style={{ width:"15%" }}
        />

        Connect the Wi-Fi antenna (provided) to a rear USB port labeled **Wi-Fi**.

        <Tip>
          If it already recognizes a previously used network and the credentials are still valid, the connection will be automatic, making the following steps unnecessary.
        </Tip>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Verify connection">
        The Wi-Fi icon will appear at the top of the HOME screen. Initially, it will be shown in gray (no signal).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Access available networks">
        Turn the encoder to **SETUP**, press to access, then select **Wi-Fi**.\
        A list of available networks will be displayed.

        <img
          src="/images/mx2200/mx2200-setup_WiFi.bmp"
          alt="Mx2200 Setup Wi Fi Bm"
          title="Mx2200 Setup Wi Fi Bm"
          style={{ width:"47%" }}
        />
      </Step>
      <Step title="Select and connect">
        Choose the desired network and enter the password using the **DATA ENTRY** keypad.

        <img
          src="/images/mx2200/mx2200-display-wifi.pass.png"
          alt="Mx2200 Display Wifi Pass Pn"
          title="Mx2200 Display Wifi Pass Pn"
          style={{ width:"48%" }}
        />

        - If the password is valid, the network assigns an IP address (visible in **SETUP/Wi-Fi**). This may take a few seconds.
        - If incorrect, the IP will remain at **0.0.0.0** and you must repeat the procedure.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Confirm connection">
        Once connected, the Wi-Fi icon on the main screen will show the **signal strength**.\
        The equipment is ready for SIP calls, RTP streaming, or web server connection.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    <Note>
      You can verify Internet access by connecting a mobile phone or laptop to the same Wi-Fi network and browsing the web.\
      It's also possible to use a **mobile phone in Hotspot mode**, creating a Wi-Fi node to which the MX2200 will connect.
    </Note>
    <Warning>
      **Public open networks**\
      Always verify the network being used. On open networks with web login, the MX2200 may indicate "connection OK" even when there is no actual Internet access.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Ethernet Connection">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Connect cable">
        Using a standard UTP cable, connect the MX2200's **Ethernet** port to the local network.
      </Step>
      <Step title="IP assignment">
        By default, the console has **DHCP enabled**, so the router/switch will automatically assign an IP address.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Verify IP">
        On the **SETUP** screen, confirm that a valid address has been assigned (different from **0.0.0.0**).
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    <Note>
      To verify Internet access, connect a laptop to the same network and open a web browser.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="4G/5G Connection">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Connect USB modem">
        Connect a **4G/5G USB modem** (not provided) to the indicated rear ports.\
        Use a USB extension cable of at least **30 cm**.

        <img
          src="/images/mx2200/mx2200-MODEM.png"
          alt="Mx2200 MODEM Pn"
          title="Mx2200 MODEM Pn"
          style={{ width:"49%" }}
        />
      </Step>
      <Step title="Verify icon">
        Once detected, the **4G** icon will appear on the main screen.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Confirm operation">
        The equipment is ready to initiate SIP calls, RTP streaming, or web server connection.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    <Warning>
      Do not connect the modem **directly** to the console: it can cause **audio interference**.\
      Always use the USB extension cable.
    </Warning>
