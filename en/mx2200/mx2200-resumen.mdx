## Description

The **Solidyne MX2200** codec-mixer is a compact unit for field work and remote broadcasting. It handles multiple connection technologies with simple and intuitive operation.

It can be configured from its **onboard display** or, when connected to a network, from a computer using a web browser.

It is powered by a **12 VDC / 1.25A** switching power supply, and its internal battery provides up to **4 hours of autonomy**.

## Link and Transmission

**Link types:**

1. Wired Ethernet
2. Wi-Fi (using external antenna)
3. 4G LTE (using USB modem)
4. Bluetooth (to a mobile phone)
5. Landline telephone (POTS)

**Transmission methods:**

1. VoIP through SIP calls (full duplex)
2. Streaming to Icecast or Shoutcast servers
3. RTP streaming
4. Audio via mobile telephony
5. Conventional telephone call

## Recording

The MX2200 can record over **100 hours** in its internal memory in **MP3** format.\
Automatic time-based cut can be set.

Recorded files are accessed by connecting the console to the local network and using a computer with any web browser.

## Audio Inputs

**Microphones**\
Three 100mm faders control up to 4 dynamic microphones.\
Fader #3 handles inputs **MIC 3** and **MIC 4**. When both inputs are used, microphones of the same brand and model should be used.

Level differences between voices are partially compensated by an **internal compressor** that acts on the microphone mix.

**Lines**\
The MX2200 features two stereo inputs for line signals:

- One analog input (TRS connector)
- USB port for direct computer connection

## Telephone Connections

The unit handles:

- One conventional telephone line
- One Bluetooth-linked mobile phone

These communications can be used as the **main link** to the studio or as backup for the data connection (streaming or SIP).\
When not used as a link, they can be integrated into the program mix.

<Warning>
  **Warning!** CONFERENCE between telephone line and Bluetooth **is not supported**.\
  Both lines can be put on air, but they won't hear each other or be able to dialogue.
</Warning>

## Monitoring and Cue

- Up to **4 headphones** can be connected on the rear panel. There is a single master volume adjustment. For differentiated levels, it is recommended to use an external headphone distributor or headphones with built-in volume control.
- An **onboard talkback microphone** allows private communication to the linked mobile or telephone line, or sending messages to the headphones.
- The monitoring circuit (**CUE**) allows listening to signals before sending them to the program mix, for example to dialogue with the lines.

**On Air Light (Tally light)**\
If an on-air light is connected, **HEADPHONES #1** output becomes a speaker output, as it mutes when microphones are active, preventing feedback.

## Outputs

The MX2200 offers:

- Stereo analog output
- USB stereo send
- An integrated CODEC that allows simultaneous generation of:
  - One SIP communication (full duplex)
  - Two streams: one to an IP address via RTP and another to an Icecast/Shoutcast server

The main mix includes a **stereo insert point (analog)** to connect an external audio processor.
