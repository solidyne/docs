**RTP** connection offers maximum quality and low latency, but requires **network configuration** at both ends (transmitter and receiver).\
It is ideal for **fixed installations** or locations with **known and controlled networks**.

<Warning>
  **Network Prerequisites**\
  Make sure you have the correct **IP/port** defined and have resolved **NAT / firewall / port forwarding** at the receiver. Without this preparation, the link may not establish.
</Warning>

  <Tab title="Start RTP from MX2200">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open Connection Center">
        Turn the **encoder** to **CONNECTION CENTER** and press it to enter connection options.

          title="Mx2200 Connection Center Pn"
          style={{ width:"50%" }}
        />
      </Step>
      <Step title="Select RTP STREAM">
        Choose **RTP STREAM** and press to open the RTP link screen (enable/disable).

          title="Mx2200 Conection Center RTP Pn"
          style={{ width:"51%" }}
        />
      </Step>
      <Step title="Enable the link">
        Select **YES** to start the RTP link to the studios.

          title="Mx2200 Connection Center RT Penable Pn"
          style={{ width:"51%" }}
        />

        When active, both **CONNECTION CENTER** and **HOME** screens show **RTP STREAM ENABLED**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="End the link">
        Repeat the procedure and select **NO** to disable RTP.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    <Info>
      Before starting, verify that the **network and audio format** configuration in the MX2200 matches what is expected at the receiver (destination IP, **port**, **codec** and **sampling rate**).
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Return from Studios">
    **RTP transmission is unidirectional**. Return is not typically used in this mode because the location generates content without studio interaction.

    <Note>
      If you need **return audio** (intercom or floor), use a **SIP call** or **telephone communication** (Bluetooth mobile or POTS landline) in parallel to RTP.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Studio Reception (VLC)">
    To receive streaming from an MX2200 on a **computer**, use software with **RTP** support. **VLC Player** (free) is recommended.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Choose compatible format">
        Configure the MX2200 with a format that the receiver supports directly:

        - **PCM16 @ 44.1 kHz** (linear)
        - **MP3** (any available mode)

        <Note>
          **OPUS** requires an **SDP (Session Description)** file to describe the content to the player.
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Open network location in VLC">
        In **VLC Player** go to **Media → Open Network Location**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Enter the URL">
        Use the format:

        ```
        [protocol]://[source_IP]:[port]
        ```

        Example:

        ```
        rtp://0.0.0.0:3030
        ```

        Where:

        - `rtp` is the protocol used by MX2200.
        - `0.0.0.0` means "**listen from any incoming IP**" on the receiving PC.
        - `3030` is the configured **port** for reception.

        <Info>
          Some VLC versions also accept: `rtp://@:3030`
        </Info>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Verify firewall/port">
        Ensure the configured **UDP port** is **allowed** in both system firewall and studio router.
