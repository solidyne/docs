## System Settings

The SYS CONFIG option in the SETTINGS screen allows configuring different system functions.

### **1** <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Start On-Air Input

Defines which input will automatically go on-air if the console restarts due to a power failure.\
For stereo inputs, any channel of the pair can be selected.

The chosen input must be assigned to a physical or virtual channel. The console always starts with the last used scene; therefore, if the station works in automated mode, make sure the selected scene has at least one channel assigned with the input defined for "automatic startup".

The audio source connected to that input must also resume autonomously.

**Default Bus**\
Indicates which buses will be activated on the channel assigned to the input defined in `Start on-air input`.

**Level**\
Preset level, independent of the physical fader position. If the fader is moved, the level will change to the value corresponding to its current position.

### **2** <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Network Settings (Remote Access)

Configures network connection for remote control via Ethernet Control.\
By default, the console works in **DHCP** mode. The IP address assigned by the router is shown on the main screen (field _UNIDEX IP_ in the **STATUS** section).

Using this IP, the console can be accessed from any computer on the same LAN using a web browser.\
UNIDEX includes an internal HTML5 server that provides the graphical interface to operate and configure all its functions.

### **1** <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Clock Settings

Opens a window to adjust the time. The adjustment can be done in three ways:

1. **Automatic synchronization via STREAMING port**\
   Connect the STREAMING Ethernet port to a LAN with Internet access. Synchronization is performed automatically against an international time standard (UTC), without user intervention.
2. **Automatic synchronization via CONTROL port**\
   Connect the CONTROL Ethernet port to a LAN with Internet access. This synchronizes the console's internal clock (_UX-Core_). Then manually synchronize the control computer (touch screen) by pressing the **SYNC FROM UX-CORE** option.
3. **Manual adjustment**\
   Enter the time manually in cases where there is no Internet access.

**Time Zone**\
Define the corresponding time zone in the `Time Zone` field.

## Users and Access Levels

These are accessed from the **SETTINGS** screen, under the **USERS** option.\
UNIDEX has three user levels:

- **ADMIN**
- **EXPERT**
- **BASIC**

The **ADMIN** and **EXPERT** profiles are password protected, defined from this screen.\
Only the **ADMIN** user can modify passwords.\
Default passwords are the usernames in lowercase: `admin` and `expert`.

#### How to Start with Restricted Access

The `DEFAULT USER` option defines which user is loaded when powering up the console.\
The default user is **ADMIN** and at startup, the system never requests a password.

To **restrict access** to advanced functions, it is recommended to change the default user (**ADMIN**) to **BASIC** or **EXPERT**, depending on the desired restriction level.

- If the console starts with **BASIC** level, the operator must enter the **EXPERT** or **ADMIN** password to access restricted functions.
- If it starts with **EXPERT** level, only functions requiring **ADMIN** level are locked.
