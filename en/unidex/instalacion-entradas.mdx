<Tip>
  Each input can be assigned to any physical or virtual channel.
</Tip>

## <Icon icon="arrow-right-to-line" iconType="solid" color="#008dff" size="22" />  Microphone Inputs

The balanced microphone inputs support **48V** _phantom_ power. The voltage can be enabled/disabled for each channel from the screen.

Each input has a **microswitch that allows reducing the preamplifier gain by -12 dB**. The switch in the down position **activates the attenuation**.

<Info>
  In UX18, the MIC-5 input has fixed level.

## <Icon icon="arrow-right-to-line" iconType="solid" color="#6f07ab" size="22" />  UNIDEX Type Inputs

**UNIDEX** type inputs are special inputs that, in addition to audio, carry **PoE power** and **control communication** channels to operate Solidyne **UDX** external adapters.

They are normally used to connect **UDX adapters** that allow adding microphones, telephone lines or mobile phones.

UNIDEX inputs can also **be used as conventional balanced inputs**. Each UNIDEX input connector contains left and right balanced signals.

## <Icon icon="arrow-right-to-line" iconType="solid" color="#008dff" size="22" />  Balanced Analog Inputs

- Each input uses a **single** STP cable that carries the **left and right** balanced signals.
- At the end, the RJ45 adapts to the required audio connector type (XLR, TRS, RCA).

To connect a source in **unbalanced mode**, an **appropriate adapter cable** must be used, connecting:

- The **(-)** signal terminal to the cable **shield**.
- The **(+)** signal terminal as the signal **hot**.

## <Icon icon="arrow-right-to-line" iconType="solid" color="#008dff" size="22" />  AES3 Digital Inputs

- Connected using **RJ45-RJ45 CAT5** cable, using the **SOL-F3/XLRF** adapter.
- To facilitate wiring compatibility, they use the **same pin-out** as stereo balanced inputs, although the cable **only uses the left channel** for the AES3 signal.
- Support **S/PDIF** signals.

<Note>
  When the streaming downlink function is enabled, the decoded audio internally replaces the **AES1** input. The rear panel **AES-1** connector is automatically disconnected.
</Note>

## External Tuner Input

The console has a **stereo input for external tuner** (ON AIR MONITOR) via **1/4" TRS** connector (unbalanced). This input is available in the monitoring assignment for both Studio and Control Room, allowing direct monitoring of the tuned signal.

<Tip>
  For FM, it is important that both in the studios and control room, monitoring is done with the **processed on-air signal**, not from the direct PGM bus. This allows detecting actual broadcast errors and provides more comfortable listening, without volume jumps that may occur in the direct signal.
</Tip>

<Note>
  In **UX18** the **ON AIR MONITOR** input can also be assigned to a channel; thus operating as an additional auxiliary input when not used for on-air monitoring.

  When assigned to a channel, it remains available as a selectable source in the monitoring section.
