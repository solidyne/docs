## Startup sequence

When powering on the console, UX24 starts its operating system. Once the startup sequence is complete, the **main screen** appears and loads:

1. The **default user profile.**
2. The **last active scene** before shutdown.

## User profile and permissions

The user profile determines the **access level to functions** within the console.\
From settings, you can define which profile loads automatically at startup.\
By default, the console starts with the **ADMIN** profile, which has full access.

### Available user levels

1. **BASIC** – Restricted access to essential functions
2. **EXPERT** – Advanced access (password required)
3. **ADMIN** – Full access (password required)

<Info>
  During startup, **no password is required**, even if the default profile has protection.\
  For UX24 to start in restricted mode and require a password for advanced functions, you must **change the default profile** to one other than ADMIN.
</Info>

For more information about user configuration, see:\
**SETTINGS → USERS**

## CPU shutdown

The UX24 console has an **internal CPU** that must be **safely shut down** before completely disconnecting the console.

### CPU shutdown procedure:

1. On the **main screen**, tap the **"+"** icon located in the **STATUS** section.

   <img
     src="/images/ux24/STATUS+.png"
     alt="Main Screen - STATUS+"
     title="Main Screen - STATUS+"
     style={{ width:"24%" }}
   />
2. In the popup window, select the **POWER-OFF** option.

   <img
     src="/images/ux24/UX24_ODROID_STATUS+POWEROFF.png"
     alt="UNIDEX STATUS+ POWEROFF"
     title="UNIDEX STATUS+ POWEROFF"
     style={{ width:"53%" }}
   />

<Warning>
  This function **does not power off the entire console**, it only shuts down the system's main CPU.\
  Complete power off is done using the mechanical power on/off **key switch** located on the rear panel.
</Warning>

After shutting down the CPU, **wait a few seconds** before completely powering off the console to allow proper closure of internal processes.

## System actions

System actions are available from the main screen by accessing **STATUS → "+"**.

These functions allow you to **separately restart different system stages**, and are not used during normal operation.

<Info>
  Reset actions are technical maintenance tools.\
  Under normal operating conditions, **it is not necessary to execute them**.
</Info>

### Available options

- **RESET USB**\
  Restarts only the USB stage.\
  Forces the operating system to re-recognize connected USB devices.
- **RESET MIXER**\
  Restarts UX24's internal mixing engine and control surface.\
  Does not affect the CPU or display.
- **RESET DISPLAY**\
  Restarts the onboard computer that manages **streaming** and the **graphical interface**.
- **FULL RESET**\
  Restarts all UX24 system stages.\
  Equivalent to a complete power off and power on of the equipment.
