## Startup Sequence

When powering on the console, UNIDEX starts its operating system. Once the startup sequence is complete, the **main screen** appears and loads:

1. The **default user profile.**
2. The **last active scene** before shutdown.

## User Profile and Permissions

The user profile determines the **access level to functions** within the console.\
From settings, you can define which profile loads automatically at startup.\
From factory, the console starts with the **ADMIN** profile, which has full access.

### Available User Levels

1. **BASIC** – Restricted access to essential functions
2. **EXPERT** – Advanced access (password required)
3. **ADMIN** – Full access (password required)

<Info>
  During startup, **no password is required**, even if the default profile has protection.\
  For UX24 to start in restricted mode and require a password for advanced functions, you must **change the default profile** to one other than ADMIN.
</Info>

For more information about user configuration, see:\
**SETTINGS → USERS**

## CPU Shutdown

UNIDEX consoles have an **internal CPU** that must be **safely shut down** before completely disconnecting the console.

### CPU Shutdown Procedure:

1. On the **main screen**, tap the **"+"** icon located in the **STATUS** section.

   <img
     src="/images/ux/ux_home_status.png"
     alt="Main Screen - STATUS"
     title="Main Screen - STATUS"
     style={{ width:"24%" }}
   />
2. In the popup window, select the **POWER-OFF** option.

   <img
     src="/images/ux/ux_status_poweroff.png"
     alt="Status, resets and power-off"
     title="Status, resets and power-off"
     style={{ width:"53%" }}
   />

<Warning>
  This function **does not power off the entire console**, it only shuts down the system's main CPU.\
  Complete shutdown is done using the **mechanical power switch** (on the rear panel or external power supply depending on model).
</Warning>

After shutting down the CPU, **wait a few seconds** before completely powering off the unit to allow proper closure of internal processes.

## System Actions

System actions are available from the main screen by accessing **STATUS → "+"**.

These functions allow **separately restarting different system stages**, and are not used during normal operation.

<Info>
  Reset actions are technical maintenance tools.\
  Under normal operating conditions, **it is not necessary to execute them**.
</Info>

### Available Options

- **RESET USB**\
  Restarts only the USB stage.\
  Forces the operating system to re-recognize connected USB devices.
- **RESET MIXER**\
  Restarts UNIDEX's internal mixing engine and control surface.\
  Does not affect the CPU or display.
- **RESET DISPLAY**\
  Restarts the onboard computer that manages **streaming** and the **graphical interface**.
- **FULL RESET**\
  Restarts all system stages.\
  Equivalent to a complete power off and on of the equipment.
