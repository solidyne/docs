For assembling connection cables, it is recommended to:

- Use **shielded RJ45 connectors**.
- Use premium quality **CAT-5 STP or S/FTP cable**.
- Ensure the connector shield is properly bonded to the cable shield.

The following table shows the standard color coding and pin numbering for RJ45 connectors.

## RJ45 Standard Nomenclature

<Warning>
  SOL-M12/minijack adapters (to female mini plug) can be connected to balanced or unbalanced OUTPUTS. Not recommended for unbalancing inputs as they leave the (-) pin unconnected, which may introduce noise.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  SOL-M12/RCAM adapters (to male RCA) can be connected to balanced INPUTS to unbalance them, as they connect the balanced (-) signal to ground. **DO NOT USE ON BALANCED OUTPUTS**, as outputs must be unbalanced by leaving the (-) pin unconnected.
</Warning>
