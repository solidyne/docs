## <Icon icon="arrow-left-from-line" iconType="solid" color="#00860b" size={22} />  Analog Outputs

Each output uses an **RJ45** connector that carries **left and right** signals in a single cable. In some applications, these stereo outputs can be configured as **two independent mono channels**. For example, **UDX telephone line adapters** use unbalanced mono outputs to send signals to external communication lines.

<Info>
  Outputs labeled as PGM and/or REC (balanced) deliver the BUS mix by default.

  Other outputs are assignable and can be configured to deliver any of the mix buses or even redirect inputs (DIRECT OUT)

## <Icon icon="arrow-left-from-line" iconType="solid" color="#00860b" size={22} />  AES3 Digital Outputs

- Connected using **RJ45–RJ45 CAT5** cable and **SOL-F3/XLRM** adapter.
- Use the same **pin-out** as balanced stereo analog outputs, although **only the left channel is transmitted**.
- Also support **S/PDIF** signal connection.
- Are transformer balanced

### AES3 Output Assignment in UX24

- **AES-1** → **PGM** Bus
- **AES-2** → **REC** Bus
- **AES-3 and AES-4** → Assignable from `SETTINGS → OUTPUTS` screen

### AES3 Output Assignment in UX18

- **AES-1** → assignable
- **AES-2** → assignable

<Warning>
  **VERY IMPORTANT:** 

  **AES3 OUTPUTS ONLY OPERATE AT 48 kHz**.

  \
  It is essential to **configure the recording device** in Windows to **48,000 Hz** to avoid compatibility issues. To configure the sample rate in Windows 10:

  1. Open **System Settings** menu and select **Sound**.
  2. In **Sound Settings**, open **input device properties**.
  3. Enter **Additional device settings**.
  4. In the **Advanced** tab, set the **sample rate to 48,000 Hz**.
</Warning>
