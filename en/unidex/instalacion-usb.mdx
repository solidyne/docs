The built-in **USB** port enables stereo signal exchange between the console and a Windows 10 computer.

- <Icon icon="arrow-right-to-line" iconType="solid" color="#008dff" size={22} /> Provides **4 stereo playback devices** (from PC to "USB inputs" on the console).
- <Icon icon="arrow-left-from-line" iconType="solid" color="#00860b" size={22} /> Provides **4 stereo recording devices** ("USB outputs" from console to PC).

This means the computer can **send 4 stereo signals** to the console and **receive 4 stereo signals** from it.

<Info>
  Although USB is technically a data port, in this context we refer to it as **USB audio inputs and outputs**.

  - The console's "**USB outputs**" correspond to **USB recording devices** in Windows.
  - The console's "**USB inputs**" correspond to **USB playback devices** in Windows.

    Understanding this is essential to properly comprehend the signal flow.
</Info>

Signal routing to USB outputs (i.e., USB recording devices in Windows) is configured from the console in the `SETTINGS → OUTPUTS` screen

<Warning>
  The following description refers to the **built-in USB connector** on the Rear Panel.\
  To install an external **UDX-USB adapter**, refer to the section: **External UNIDEX Adapters**
</Warning>

## USB Driver Installation

UX24 requires its own USB driver to establish communication with the Windows operating system.

### Installation steps:

1. Connect the console's USB port to the PC using the supplied **USB A/B** cable.

<Danger>
  Using **poor quality or damaged** cables may cause the computer to incorrectly recognize the USB device or identify it with errors.
</Danger>

2. Download the driver from:\
   https://solidynepro.com/DW/Solidyne_UsbAudio.zip
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions.

### USB Devices in Windows

Once the driver is properly installed, Windows will show:

Playback devices (outputs from PC to UX24):

- **Solidyne USB OUT 1 →** USB Input 1 (UX24)
- **Solidyne USB OUT 2 →** USB Input 2 (UX24)
- **Solidyne USB OUT 3 →** USB Input 3 (UX24)
- **Solidyne USB OUT 4 →** USB Input 4 (UX24)

Recording devices (sends from UX24 to PC):

- **Solidyne USB IN 1 ←** USB Output 1 (UX24)
- **Solidyne USB IN 2 ←** USB Output 2 (UX24)
- **Solidyne USB IN 3 ←** USB Output 3 (UX24)
- **Solidyne USB IN 4 ←** USB Output 4 (UX24)

These outputs are assigned from the screen at: `SETTINGS → OUTPUTS`

## ASIO 3.0 Compatibility

The **UX24 console supports ASIO 3.0**, allowing simultaneous sharing of USB channels between different applications.

### Advanced application example:

- Automation software plays music through **USB 1** channel.
- Another processing software (like an effects host) takes the **USB 2** channel returning from the console and applies real-time **VST effects** to microphone voices.
