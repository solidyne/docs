## PROCESS SCREEN

Press **PROCESS** on the main screen to access. This also activates **SELECT mode** to choose a channel.

Processors are **fixed to each input**, not to the channel. They cannot be reassigned to other channels, buses or outputs. Available processes depend on the **input type** assigned to the channel.

| **INPUT** | **EQ \+ Filters** | **Comp. \+ Gate** | **De-esser** |
| :---------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :----------: |
| MIC         | 4 bands           | **yes**           | **yes**      |
| UNIDEX      | 3 bands           | **yes**          | no           |
| USB         | 3 bands          | no                | no           |
| AES3        | 3 bands          | no                | no           |
| BALANCED    | 3 bands          | no                | no           |

**PROCESS screen functions**

- View which processors are on the channel and if they are active or in **BYPASS**.
- Enable/disable a processor by touching **BYPASS**.
- Access settings by touching the icon or contextual button.

**Channel selection**

- In SELECT mode, use **CUE/SELECT** on the console or the **encoder** to scroll through all 24 channels (physical in cyan, virtual in purple).
- Any action in PROCESS cancels SELECT, applying changes to the active channel.
- SELECT can also be activated from PROCESS to choose another channel.

**Parameter adjustment:**\
Done by combining the **encoder** and **touch options**, as indicated for each processor.

<Note>
  Process settings can be **saved in the scene**.

## PARAMETRIC EQUALIZER

<img

  title="UNIDEX EQ"
  style={{ width:"71%" }}
/>

**1 - NAME:** Shows channel number and name. Virtual channels display the name area in purple.

**2 - BANDS:** Band selection. Screen shows parameters for one band at a time.\
Each band has a color that identifies it in the graph and parameter area.\
All inputs have 3 parametric bands, except MIC-1 to MIC-4 inputs which have four bands.

**3 - CONTROLS:** Parameters for each EQ band. Background color changes with selected band.

- **GAIN:** Gain in dB, with a range of ± 9 dB.
- **FREQ:** Adjusts working frequency. All bands cover 20 Hz to 20 kHz.
- **Q:** EQ bell width. Determines precision of applied correction.
- **TYPE:** Band operation mode. Toggle by touching TYPE on screen.
  - Band #1: peak, low-shelf or HPF.
  - Band #2 (and #3 on microphone inputs): peak or HPF/LPF.
  - Band #3 (#4 on mic inputs): peak, hi-shelf or LPF.
- **ON/OFF:** Band enable/disable. Toggle by touching ON/OFF on screen.

**4 - BY-PASS:** Disables entire equalization stage. Also appears on PROCESS screen.\
Toggle by touching BY-PASS on screen.

**5 - SELECT:** Activates channel selection mode.

**6 - BACK:** Returns to previous screen.

### High-Pass / Low-Pass Filters

- Band #1 can function as 2nd order high-pass filter (HPF) (12 dB/oct).
- Band #3 (Band #4 on MIC-1 to MIC-4 inputs) can function as 2nd order low-pass filter (LPF) (12 dB/oct).
- Band #2 (and Band #3 on MIC-1 to MIC-4 inputs) can work as HPF or LPF.\
  If two bands are configured as high-pass or low-pass at the same frequency, total cutoff attenuation will be **24 dB/oct**.

## DYNAMICS

The **DYNAMIC** processor includes a **noise gate** and a **compressor**.

  alt="UNIDEX Dynamics"
  title="UNIDEX Dynamics"
  style={{ width:"65%" }}
/>

**1 - COMPRESSION CURVE:** Graphically shows input-output relationship of dynamic processor, including gate and compressor.

**2 - INPUT LEVEL:** Shows peak signal level at compressor input (dBfs).

### 3 - Noise Gate

- **Threshold:** Gate activation threshold (dB).
- **Attenuation:** Applied signal attenuation when gate is active.
- **Style:** Changes recovery time between preset values.
- **Active:** Indicator lights red when gate is closed.

### 4 - Dynamic Compressor

Controls for adjusting:

- Threshold
- Ratio
- Attack time
- Release time
- Hold
- Output gain

**5 - BYPASS:** Completely disables dynamic processing stage (gate \+ compressor).

## DE-ESSER

  alt="UNIDEX De-esser"
  title="UNIDEX De-esser"
  style={{ width:"65%" }}
/>

**MIC-1** to **MIC-4** inputs include a **de-esser** for sibilance reduction.\
This processor works as a multiband compressor, attenuating only the defined frequency range when signal level exceeds the set threshold.

**Controls:**

- **1 - Type:** Preset settings.
- **2 - Frequency start:** Lower cutoff frequency. Adjusted according to voice characteristics. Usually between 4,500 and 5,500 Hz.
- **3 - Frequency end:** Upper cutoff frequency. Adjusted according to voice characteristics. Usually between 7,000 and 10,000 Hz.
- **4 - Threshold:** Threshold level in dB. When signal in working band exceeds this value, it is attenuated with a **fixed 15:1 ratio**.
- **5 - Gain reduction:** Shows applied level reduction in dB.
