UNIDEX /A67 models include a DANTE/AES67 module that provides **16 mono inputs and 16 mono outputs** AoIP.

Using UNIDEX in an AoIP network requires compatible DANTE connection nodes to input signals from:

- Microphone preamplifiers
- Computers playing through DANTE VIRTUAL SOUNDCARD
- Line-level signals, for example from another DANTE console

Any compatible DANTE interface can connect to UNIDEX. \
Computers can play directly via AoIP. This requires installing DANTE "virtual soundcard", which is Audinate software that provides AoIP channels through a gigabit network. These drivers are inexpensive and widely used to interconnect computers with the console and with each other.

<Warning>
  DANTE implementation requires audio networking knowledge.

## DANTE Port Connection

### General Considerations

- The DANTE Ethernet port connects to a QoS gigabit switch using CAT5e or CAT6 cable to build the AoIP network.
- Typically the console will act as Master Clock in the network.
- UNIDEX supports redundant connection, where two physical networks, built with different switches, operate in parallel. This is used in large AoIP installations to protect transmission against network failure. Switching between networks is automatic.
- The AoIP network can be used to connect UNIDEX's REMOTE CONTROL port and control the console remotely from computers on the AoIP network.

### DANTE Network Configuration

On UNIDEX, the **SETTINGS - AoIP** screen shows the status of the DANTE/AES67 module and network.

Managing input and output devices, both for the UNIDEX console and other interfaces like computers, is done from a network-connected computer running [**DANTE CONTROLLER**](https://www.getdante.com/products/software-essentials/dante-controller/) software developed by Audinate, a software matrix that allows assigning inputs and outputs between networked devices.

### DANTE Inputs and Outputs

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="UX24">
    **INPUTS**\
    In UX24 consoles **the DANTE /A67 module installation replaces 8 stereo analog inputs** (8-IN module).\
    **UNIDEX inputs 5, 6, 7, 8** and **balanced inputs 9, 10, 11, 12** are replaced by AoIP-1 through AoIP-16 inputs.

    **DANTE OUTPUTS**\
    The DANTE /A67 module installation does not affect UX24 outputs.\
    The DANTE module provides 16 mono AoIP sends (8 stereo) replicating 5 existing console stereo outputs and adding 3 more (6 mono) via AoIP, assignable.

  <Tab title="UX18">
    **INPUTS**\
    In UX18 consoles **the DANTE /A67 module installation does not affect the available inputs** on the console.\
    DANTE **adds 16 additional inputs** via AoIP.

    **DANTE OUTPUTS**\
    The DANTE /A67 module installation does not affect UX18 outputs.\
    The DANTE module provides 16 mono AoIP sends (8 stereo) replicating 4 existing console stereo outputs and adding 4 more (or 8 mono) via AoIP, assignable.
