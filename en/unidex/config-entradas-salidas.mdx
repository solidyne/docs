## INPUTS SETTINGS

### **2** <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Input List

Shows all available inputs.\
<Icon icon="arrows-rotate-reverse" iconType="solid" color="#0400ff" size={16} /> Select an input by **turning the encoder**.\
The options and configuration for the selected input are shown on the right.

- The **ID number** on the left of each input is fixed and corresponds to the internal order.
- The **number on the right** indicates the **assigned channel** for that input.
- Stereo inputs are shown grouped in **L/R** pairs.
  - When set to `STEREO`, they are grouped as a pair.
  - When set to `MONO`, left and right channels are unlinked and can be selected separately.

### **3** <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Input Gain

Controls the gain of the selected input.\
<Icon icon="arrows-rotate-reverse" iconType="solid" color="#0400ff" size={16} /> Turn the encoder to modify the value.\
<Icon icon="arrow-down-to-line" iconType="solid" color="#0400ff" size={16} /> Press the encoder to toggle between list navigation and gain adjustment.

The level indicator shows the peak signal value at the input (dBfs).

**Quick gain adjustment:**

1. Play music with low dynamics (e.g. current pop) for line inputs,\
   or speak continuously at normal level and correct distance for microphone inputs.
2. Position the channel fader in the normal working zone (marked between -10 dB and -20 dB).
3. Adjust gain until the **PROGRAM** VU meter reads around 0 VU. Observe the slow reading (VU), not the dBfs peak, as the peak will always "float" above the VU value.

   <Tip>
     The numerical indication to the right of the main indicator can be toggled between dBFS and VU by touching the number.
   </Tip>

<Info>
  This gain control is also shown on the CHANNEL screen. Gain adjustment can be done from either screen.
</Info>

### **4** <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Input Options

Available options **depend on the type** of selected input:

- **INPUT TYPE**: Indicates input type (MIC, LINE, UDX, USB, AES).
- **MODE**: Stereo or mono. In mono, L/R channels are configured as independent inputs.
- **ASSIGNED TO CHANNEL**: Channel where the selected input signal is routed.\
  Channel is chosen from the dropdown menu. This option is also shown on the CHANNEL screen.
- **PHANTOM**: Available only for MIC inputs. Enables/disables 48V power.
- **UDX TYPE**: Available only on UNIDEX inputs. Defines the connected adapter model.\
  If used as balanced line, value should be `LINE` (default).

### **5** <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Process

Direct access to available processes for the input.\
During normal operation, these are accessible from PROCESS and CHANNEL screens.

### **6** <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Select

Activates **SELECT** mode, allowing channel selection via **CUE/SELECT** buttons and displaying the assigned input.\
The encoder always navigates the input list, even with SELECT active.

## OUTPUTS SETTINGS

<img
  src="/images/ux24/ux24-odroid-outputs.png"
  alt="UX24 Outputs"
  title="UX24 Outputs"
  style={{ width:"75%" }}
/>

### **1** <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Output List

Shows all available outputs.\
<Icon icon="arrows-rotate-reverse" iconType="solid" color="#0400ff" size={16} /> Selection is made by **turning the encoder** or touching directly on screen.\
Configuration options for the selected output are shown on the right.

### **2** <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Output Gain

Adjusts output level. Depending on output type, adjustment may be in dBu or dBfs.

- **Analog outputs:** level is expressed in dBu referenced to 0 VU (default: +4 dBu).
- **Digital outputs:** gain is expressed in dB.\
  When gain is zero (default), level matches meter scale\
  (0 VU = –20 dBfs, 1 kHz @ 0 VU).

Press encoder to toggle between output list navigation and gain control. <Icon icon="arrows-rotate-reverse" iconType="solid" color="#0400ff" size={16} /> To change value, **turn the encoder**.

<Danger>
  PGM, REC and AUX meters on main screen show bus level **before** output gains. If digital gain is modified, actual output level may differ from indicated level,\
  with clipping risk not visible on meters.
</Danger>

### **3** <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Audio Mode

Configures output as `stereo` or `mono`. In mono mode, left and right channels of the pair are used as independent outputs (for example, to feed UDX 2TEL adapters sending mono signals to lines).

### **6** <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Source

Only available on assignable outputs. Defines signal sent to that output.\
For outputs with MIX-MINUS option, defines source signal for output in **DIRECT** mode.

**Available sources for UX-24 outputs:**\
\
`PGM, REC, AUX, VBUS, CUE, STUDIO HEADPHONES, TALKBACK, MIC-1, MIC-2, MIC-3, MIC-4, UDX-1 to UDX-8`

**Available sources for UX-18 outputs:**

| **OUTPUTS (ST)**             | **SOURCE**                                                                                        |

## Mix-Minus Sends

A MIX-MINUS output sends a mix from which an associated input signal is SUBTRACTED. It's used, for example, for telephone line return, preventing call audio from\
re-entering the system and causing feedback. The line receives a _PGM MIX-MINUS_, which is the PGM signal MINUS the telephone line audio.

**Stereo outputs** (5 to 8 in UX24; 1 to 4 in UX18) and all **USB** can be configured as **Direct** or **Mix-Minus**.

  style={{ width:"42%" }}
/>

### **7** <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Send Mode

- **Direct**: Normal output operation mode. MIX-MINUS is disabled. Signal defined in SOURCE is sent directly to output.
- **Mix-Minus**: Associated input signal is subtracted from output signal.

### **8** <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Mix-Minus Source

Defines bus for subtraction: `PGM, REC, AUX, VBUS or AUTO ASSIGN`.\
In **AUTO ASSIGN**, bus is automatically chosen by priority:

Priority 1 - PGM\
Priority 2 - REC\
Priority 3 - AUX\
Priority 4 - VBUS

For example:

- If a channel is assigned to PGM and REC, Mix-Minus is done on PGM.
- If assigned only to REC and AUX, it's done on REC.

### **9** <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Mix-Minus Channel

Shows input associated with selected output and channel assigned to that input.\
These fields cannot be edited.\
Each Mix-Minus mode output has its predetermined associated input.

<Warning>
  For an output to work in Mix-Minus, the associated input **must be assigned to a channel**.\
  If not assigned, the option remains disabled.
</Warning>

Default MIX-MINUS assignments for UX24:

## Special Options for Talk-Back and Intercom

### Intercom (UX24 only)

Enables intercom send to that output. When assigned **Intercom** button is pressed on console, talkback mic audio interrupts current output signal. Used, for example, to set up differentiated talkback sends to headphone monitoring.

### Studio B Speakers (UX24 only)

Allows using output to feed monitor speakers in **Studio B**.\
When microphones assigned to this studio are activated, output is automatically muted.

### Talk-Back Ch and Studio Talk-Back Link (UX18 only)

These options allow configuring UX18 to work with **differentiated talkback channels** and headphone groups. For connection details see _Configuring StudioBox with dual Talk-Back channel_.

**Talk-Back Channel:** Links output to hardware channel _talk-back_ mode.

- _Talk-back_ is activated from a channel by holding the **CUE/SELECT** button.
- When activated on a channel associated with an output, talkback mic signal (internal or external) is sent **only to that output**, interrupting current audio.
- Dropdown menu allows selecting:
  - Channels 1 to 6
  - A GROUP channel (A, B, C or D)
  - Disable function (_unassigned_)

**Studio Talk-Back Link:** Links output to console's main **Talk-Back** button.

- When Talk-Back is pressed, talkback mic is sent to **STUDIO** output and all outputs with _Studio Talk-Back Link_ enabled.
