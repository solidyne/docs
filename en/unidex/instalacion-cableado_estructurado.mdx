## General Considerations

UNIDEX consoles use **RJ45** connectors for many of their inputs and outputs, using **shielded CAT-5** multipair cable.

With the adoption of Audio over IP (AoIP), RJ45 connectors became standard, allowing multiple types of analog and digital connectors to be replaced by a single format. This simplifies installations and reduces the physical size of the consoles.

Structured cabling offers several advantages:

- A single type of cable is used for the entire installation.
- No soldering required.
- Can carry analog signals, digital audio, or data.

To connect conventional audio devices (microphones, speakers, players, interfaces), **adapter cables** are used, going from RJ45 female to the corresponding audio connector (XLR, TRS, RCA, etc.).

<Warning>
  RJ45 connectors are reliable and durable **only if properly installed**.

  - It is essential to avoid hanging cables that put strain on the connectors.
  - **UDX adapters must be properly secured** and not left loose inside the rack or on the desk.
  - **Cable ducts or conduits** are recommended for cable routing.
  - For long runs, use RJ45-RJ45 and a short RJ45 female adapter to the required audio connector.
  - Use high-quality STP or SFTP structured cable.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Avoid mixing** audio cables with AC power cables. To prevent interference and hum, they must follow separate paths.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  If there is persistent hum and ground connections are correct, it may be due to **RF standing waves** induced by the FM antenna. In these cases, it is recommended to place **ferrite rings** on all cables entering the console.
