## Ethernet Connection for Remote Control

The console features an **Ethernet port** for remote control through local area network (LAN). The **internal web control interface** can be accessed using a web browser from any computer connected to the same network.

### Step 1: Physical Connection

Connect the UNIDEX **CONTROL ETHERNET** port to a **router** port using a standard Ethernet network cable.

<Warning>
  Do not confuse the **CONTROL** Ethernet connector with the **STREAMING** Ethernet port.

  />
</Warning>

- By default, UNIDEX is configured with **DHCP enabled**.
- The router will automatically assign an available IP address. This IP may change when restarting the console, unless a static IP is configured, but this is usually not necessary.
- The current IP address is displayed on the console's **main screen** under:\
  **UNIDEX IP.**

    className="mx-auto"
  />
- If a static IP is required, go to:`SETTINGS → SYSTEM`

### Step 2: Web Browser Access

From any computer connected to the **same local network** (via cable or Wi-Fi), open a web browser (recommended: **Google Chrome**) and enter the IP address shown as **UNIDEX IP**.

<Note>
     **Solidyne Multi-Discovery**

     If physical access to the console is not available, you can [**download the Multi-Discovery tool**](/es/unidex/unidex-discovery) that detects Solidyne devices connected to the network.
</Note>

This will open the web interface for console operation and configuration. The interface is similar to the one shown on the **onboard touchscreen**.

## Ethernet Connection for Streaming Services

1. Connect the **Streaming Out** port to the LAN router using a standard Ethernet cable.

   <Warning>
     DO NOT CONFUSE the **streaming Ethernet connector** with the **remote control** Ethernet connector.\
     Both use RJ45, but serve completely different functions.

       style={{ width:"40%" }}
       className="mx-auto"
     />
   </Warning>
2. The router will assign an IP address via **DHCP**, visible on the main screen as: **Stream IP**
3. This IP may change when restarting the console, unless a static IP is configured.
4. Streaming services can be configured in two ways:
   - From the console's **touchscreen**.
   - From any computer on the network by accessing the **Stream IP** address through a web browser.
