## STUDIO MONITOR Output Connector

The **STUDIO MONITOR** output connector carries the monitoring signals to the main studio (Studio A).

**Solidyne StudioBox HD3 and HD5** monitoring bays connect directly to this output using an **RJ45–RJ45 STP** cable with **pin-to-pin** connection.

When not using a StudioBox, the console includes an **RJ45 to audio connectors** adapter cable, allowing direct connection of active speakers and headphone distributors in the studio.

<Warning>
  The **STUDIO MONITOR** output must not be connected using cables other than the original or through generic RJ45 adapter sections. This can cause failures or damage to the Studio Monitor output.
</Warning>

The signals present in the **STUDIO MONITOR** connector are:

| **PIN** | **SIGNAL**                    |
| :-----: | ----------------------------- |
| 1       | Headphones Left (\+4 dBu)     |
| 2       | Headphones Right              |
| 3       | GND                           |
| 4       | ON-AIR (\+14 V)               |
| 5       | Talkback to Control Room      |
| 6       | VCC \+14 V                    |
