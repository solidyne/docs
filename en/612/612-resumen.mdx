## General Features

The D612 console is a compact, solid, and elegant unit. Despite its small size, it offers extensive connectivity flexibility, including digital USB input/output that enables digital communication with computers without requiring expensive sound cards.

It features five 100mm conductive ceramic faders that, combined with ETM-VCA control, provide over 10 million operations lifespan under normal use conditions.

## Inputs

### Microphones

- 2 channels handle 4 microphones.
- Microphones feature 48V phantom power, switchable from the front panel.
- Microphone mix can be assigned to a 4-band equalizer.
- Automatic dynamic range compressor on microphone mix.

Each microphone channel can handle up to two parallel microphones, connected through 4 XLR connectors (MIC-1a, MIC-1b, MIC-2a, MIC-2b).

The level between microphones sharing a channel is balanced, within certain limits, by the internal compressor. When using microphones on the same channel, we recommend using the same brand and model.

### Line Inputs

The 3 line channels allow connection of up to 6 stereo audio sources:

- Channels 3 and 4 accept unbalanced (LIN-1 and LIN-2) and balanced (BAL-1 and BAL-2) analog inputs.
- Channel 5 is digital, with direct USB computer connection, and also accepts an unbalanced auxiliary input.

All channels feature gain control that acts on the selected input (main or auxiliary).

<Note>
  In units with /AoIP option, the LIN-2 auxiliary input is internally assigned to the streaming module audio signal and cannot be used for other signals.
</Note>

## Outputs

The D612 console features two main outputs:

- **PGM (Program):** main signal for broadcast or streaming.
- **REC (Recording):** enables recording without interfering with the broadcast output.

Additionally:

- USB connection digitally delivers PGM or REC to PC, operator-selectable. The computer recognizes it as an external USB recording device.
- **Digital PGM / REC via USB** can be used for Internet broadcasting.
- **PGM via Ethernet (optional):** in models with /IP option, can send RTP streaming to transmitter site or MPEG streaming to Icecast server (see D612/IP Models).
- **External Hybrid:** dedicated send and return, integrated with internal hybrid channel.

An **On Air Light (Tally Light)** output allows connection of LED indicators. It activates when any microphone channel opens. The console also includes an LED indicator on its chassis.

<Warning>
  Maximum load on Tally Light output **must not exceed 120 mA** (two Solidyne LA100 signals).
</Warning>

## Telephone Lines

The telephone hybrid channel handles two lines: one landline (2-wire) and one cellular phone via Bluetooth. All lines can be conferenced. Many functions are automated for easier operation.

The console includes send and return for external hybrid connection. The external hybrid integrates with the built-in hybrid circuit, avoiding the use of additional channels for connection.

## Monitoring

The monitoring section distributes signals to studio and control room speakers and headphones.

- Both Studio and Control Room feature master level control and assignment keys to send air signal (external tuner), console output (PGM) or recording output (REC).
- In studios, level remains fixed on the console, and installation of active monitors and headphone distributors with their own level control is recommended.
- The Solidyne **StudioBox** accessory is an excellent complementary option.

## CUE Preview Monitoring

The console includes an internal speaker for preview monitoring with level control. CUE allows monitoring the signal before the fader (PFL). In integrated studios, the CUE speaker can be disabled and CUE sent to operator headphones.

The monitoring section also incorporates the studio talkback microphone, which is also used for private communication with telephone lines.

## ETM-VCA Faders

**ETM-VCA (Electrometric Voltage Controlled Amplifier)** technology prevents audio signal from passing through faders, reducing noise and wear. Level is controlled by low-noise, highly stable amplifiers; faders only transmit DC control signal.

Main advantages:

- Completely eliminates noise from fader wear.
- Reduces maintenance and extends service life.
- Provides outstanding stereo correlation (error less than 0.1 dB).
- Enables use of faders exceeding 10 million operations (under proper use conditions).
