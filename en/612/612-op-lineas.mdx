1. Channel **gain** adjustment.
2. **A/B:** Switch between main and auxiliary inputs.
3. **USB OUT:** USB send assignment: PGM or REC (USB channel only)
4. **BUS:** Assignment to PGM and REC buses/outputs.
5. **CUE:** Activates pre-fader listening (<Tooltip tip="Pre-Fader LEvel">PFL</Tooltip>)
6. **OVL:** indicates correct operating zone. If the fader is below this indicator, it shows excessive input gain.
7. **Fader:** Main level control. Should operate in the zone marked between -20 and -10 dB.

## Channel Inputs

Each channel has two inputs, switchable from an A/B key on the front panel.

| Channel | Available Inputs                          | Connector   |
| :---: | ------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| 3     | Balanced Stereo / Unbalanced Stereo        | DIN-5 / RCA |
| 4     | Balanced Stereo / Unbalanced Stereo        | DIN-5 / RCA |
| 5     | USB / Unbalanced Stereo Auxiliary          | USB / RCA   |

<Note>
  The USB connection also digitally sends PGM or REC to the computer.
</Note>

## Gain Adjustment

- Each channel has a **gain** knob.
- For USB signal, the level is adjusted from **Windows**.
- Adjustment should be made so that, with 0 VU meter level, the main fader operates **above the overload zone (OVL)**.

---

## Operation Use

- To send a signal on air:
  1. Assign **PGM** on the channel.
  2. Raise the fader.
- The correct operating level is achieved when **signal peaks reach 0 VU**.

---

## Fader Technology

All channel faders operate with **VCA** technology and use high-durability soft-touch attenuators.

- The fader handles **direct current (DC)** levels, which control a variable gain amplifier.
- This system guarantees **ultra-low distortion**.
- Completely eliminates noise produced by mechanical wear of faders.
- \+ 10,000,000 operations under proper use conditions.
