## Program and Recording

- **PGM (Program):** main balanced output with female **TRS 1/4"** connectors (female plug).
- **REC (Recording):** auxiliary unbalanced output with RCA connectors.

### Balanced TRS to XLR male connection (per channel)

| TRS (Plug)         | XLR (Cannon)       |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Ground = sleeve    | Pin 1 = Ground     |
| Signal (\+) = tip  | Pin 2 = Signal (\+)|
| Signal (-) = ring  | Pin 3 = Signal (-) |

<Warning>
  To unbalance the PGM output, connect the **(\+)** terminal, leaving the **(-)** terminal unconnected.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  Never use **mono plug** (TS) connectors to connect these outputs.
</Warning>

### Output Levels

- Nominal level: **\+4 dBu** when VU-meter indicates "0 VU".
- In unbalanced mode (using only \+ terminal): **-2 dBu**.

<Info>
  When connecting non-professional recording equipment, the level may be too high and cause saturation.\
  Use the device's input level control.\
  If this is not sufficient, use a fixed attenuator (resistive divider) to reduce the output level.
</Info>

## PGM USB Send

The USB connection delivers the **PGM** or **REC** signal (according to the **USB OUT** switch position on Channel 5).

- No additional installation required: the computer automatically recognizes the USB recording device.
- The signal can be used for hard disk recording or Internet streaming (Webcasting).
