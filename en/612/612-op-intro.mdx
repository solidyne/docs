## Introduction

The console controls are organized into several sections according to their function:

- Input channels
- Telephone hybrid control
- Studio monitoring and talkback
- Preview monitoring (CUE)
- Microphone equalizers
- Level and compression indicators

## Microphones

- **MIC 1 and MIC 2:** handle microphone signals only
  - **48V** phantom power is activated globally (all or none)
  - Dynamic microphones can handle 48V DC, so condenser and dynamic mics can be mixed
- Can be assigned to the processing stage (4-band equalizer and compressor)

## Lines

- **Analog lines:** accept balanced (BAL) and unbalanced (LINE) stereo inputs with A/B switching from the panel
- **USB digital channel:** handles one digital input (USB) and one analog stereo input (LINE)
- The USB connection also sends **PGM or REC** outputs to the computer

## VU Meter Bridge

The meter bridge contains LED VU meters that display:

- Program level (peak average)
- Compressor action

## Quick Check

Basic procedures to verify the console is properly connected:

### Signal Input Check

1. Connect a signal source (microphone, USB audio)
   - Select the corresponding input on the used channel (**MIC** or **BAL-LIN**)
   - This is a common source of error in line channels (wrong input selection)
2. Press **CUE** on the channel receiving the signal
3. Raise the **CUE** fader in the monitoring section
   - Audio should be heard through the console speaker

### Sending Signal On-Air

1. Assign **PGM** on the channel to send the signal to the main output
2. Raise the channel fader to the desired level
   - The signal will be sent on-air and displayed on the program VU meters
3. Adjust gain so the normal working position of the main fader is at **-15 dB** (gray zone)
