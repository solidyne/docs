## Input Channels

All input and output connectors are located on the rear panel of the console.

<Note>
  The quality of connections between different sources and the console ensures reliable and fault-free operation. Take the necessary time to make connections carefully, always using high-quality materials.
</Note>

## Microphone Inputs

The microphone channels are electronically balanced and use standard XLR connectors.

- Each channel features **two XLR connectors**, internally summed.
- When using two microphones on the same channel, they should be the same brand and model, preferably dynamic.
- Voice level differences are compensated by the console's internal compressors.

The **48V** switch, located on the front panel, activates 48V phantom power on all inputs.

<Note>
  Dynamic microphones can receive phantom power without risk of damage, as their moving coil has a floating connection that decouples the voltage.
</Note>

## Line Inputs

Each line channel has two stereo inputs, selectable from the console's front panel:

- **Channels 3 and 4:** unbalanced inputs on **RCA** connectors (LIN-1 and LIN-2) and balanced inputs on a **DIN-5** connector (BAL-1 and BAL-2).
- **Channel 5:** digital. It's a USB port for direct computer connection. Accepts an unbalanced auxiliary input (RCA).

<Note>
  In equipment with /AoIP option, the LIN-2 auxiliary input is internally assigned to the streaming module and cannot be used for other signals.
</Note>

To connect equipment with balanced output, a DIN-5 to dual female XLR or 1/4" TRS stereo connector cable must be assembled, as appropriate.

- The unbalanced RCA inputs accept equipment with -10 dBV output over 10 kΩ (consumer equipment).
- The gain control is common to both inputs and always acts on the selected input.

## Digital USB Input

Channel 5 directly connects the console to a computer via USB port (standard USB A/B cable).

- Compatible with 1.1, 2.0, and 3.0 ports.
- Recommended cable length 2-3 m; do not exceed 4 m even with extensions.
- Compatible with Windows® 7/10, Linux, and macOS.
- Drivers are installed automatically; no additional drivers required.

<Warning>
  Before connecting the console to the PC via USB, verify that the computer has effective **ground connection** through the brass terminal on the rear panel.

  - Use a multimeter set to 25 VAC between PC and console chassis; reading should be **0 V**.
  - Without proper grounding, the USB input of the console or PC could be damaged.
</Warning>

When connecting the powered console, Windows® detects a "USB playback device" and a "USB recording device". On the console, the **Digital IN/Out** indicator will show **U4**, confirming that stereo input and output were recognized.

In Windows®, this can be verified in: **Control Panel → Sound and Audio Devices**, where default playback and recording devices are defined.

In software applications, select the USB playback and recording devices.

If the PC has no other audio interface, Windows® will use USB-1 devices as default (Channel 5 input and PGM/REC output of the D612).

<Info>
  Channel 5 also features an auxiliary stereo unbalanced input with RCA connectors for conventional equipment.
