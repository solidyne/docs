- **CUE:** adjusts the CUE signal preview level.

<Note>
  The built-in speaker can be disabled and the CUE signal routed to the control room headphones.\
  This requires modifying an internal connection. See [Installation - Speakers and headphones](/es/612/612-monitoreo)
</Note>

## Level Adjustment

A single level control manages both **studio headphones** and **studio monitor speakers**.

- First adjust the headphones level.
- Then adjust the speaker level using the active monitors control.

### Individual Headphone Control Options

- **External amplifier/distributor (recommended):** for example the **Solidyne Studio Box HD5** which handles 5 headphones.
- **Headphones with built-in volume control.**
- **Custom individual control:** mount a 1 kΩ potentiometer on the announcer's desk (see Installation chapter).

---

## Studio and Control Room Speakers

- The **Studio Monitor** output is designed for **active speakers** (0 dBu level, 0.775 Vrms).
- When microphones are activated, **studio speakers are automatically muted** to prevent feedback.
- The **Control Monitor** output also has a single level control.

### Monitor Signal Selection

The selection switches choose which signal to monitor in Studio and Control Room

- **PGM:** program signal.
- **REC:** channels assigned to recording output.
- **AIR:** external input (tuner) for monitoring on-air transmission.

## Operation in Integrated Studios

In modern studios, console, announcers and journalists share the same room, reducing construction and acoustic costs.

- Connect a pair of active speakers to the **Studio Monitor** output.
  - These are automatically muted when microphones are opened.
- Journalists' and guests' headphones connect to the **Studio** output.
- Operator's headphones connect to the **Control Monitor** output.

---

## Preview Monitoring (CUE)

- The console includes an **internal speaker** for CUE.
- Each channel has a **CUE** button to preview the signal without going on-air (fader closed).
- If multiple CUE buttons are pressed, signals are summed.

In integrated studios:

- CUE configuration must be modified to send the signal to Control Room headphones and mute the built-in speaker. See [Installation - Speakers and headphones](/es/612/612-monitoreo)

The CUE knob adjusts the CUE speaker level or Control Room headphones send level.

## Studio Talkback

The talkback channel allows the operator to communicate with the announcer in the Studio:

- Press **Talkback**.
  - Audio is interrupted in Control Room speakers (to prevent feedback).
  - In the Studio, the operator is heard through the **left channel** of speakers and headphones.
  - The **right channel** continues with program audio so announcers and journalists maintain reference.
- To hear the response, the operator must activate **CUE** on the microphone channel.

<Note>
  The talkback microphone level comes factory calibrated.\
  Only if necessary, it can be adjusted with the **LEVEL** preset on the console panel using a trimmer tool.
