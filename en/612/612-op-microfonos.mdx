## Description

The console features **two microphone channels**.

1. Input **gain** adjustment.
2. **_48V phantom power_**: Activated for all microphones.
3. **EQ.** Gain controls for frequency bands.
4. **EQ.** Assignment of equalizer output to PGM and REC buses.
5. **BUS:** Assigns the channel to PGM output or to the equalizer.
6. **CUE:** Activates pre-fader listening (<Tooltip tip="Pre-Fader LEvel">PFL</Tooltip>)
7. **OVL:** indicates proper working range. If the fader is below this mark, it indicates excessive input gain.
8. **Fader:** Main level control. Should operate in the zone marked between -20 and -10 dB.

## Gain Adjustment

On microphone channels, depending on the speaker and distance to the microphone, it may be necessary to adjust the gain to work with the attenuator in the correct operating zone: above the **OVL (-30 dB)** overload indication.

<Warning>
  In any console, excessive input gain reduces dynamic range.\
  If the fader works below OVL, the signal is unnecessarily amplified and **peak clipping distortion** occurs.
</Warning>

## Assignment

Each channel can be:

- Sent directly to air (**PGM**).
- Sent to the equalizer.

The processed signal can then be sent to **PGM** and **REC**. The OFF position removes the signal from the BUS (it is not a bypass).\
A channel cannot be sent directly to REC.

## Equalization

The equalization is shared for both microphone channels.

- The spectrum extremes work in **Shelving** mode, with a range of ±15 dB.
- The controls are specifically designed for human voice:

| Band          | Type     | Center Frequency | Main Function                                    |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Bass          | Shelving | —                | Adds "body" and "weight" to voice                |
| Low-mids      | Peak EQ  | 160 Hz          | Controls resonance or popping in male voices     |
| High-mids     | Peak EQ  | 5 kHz           | Reduces **sibilance** and hissing problems       |
| Treble        | Shelving | —                | Adds "presence" and improves intelligibility     |

## Compression

The **compressor** maintains constant voice peaks:

- Acts whenever the microphone mix exceeds **0 VU**.
- Below that level, the dynamic range remains intact.
- Has steep compression slope, with fast attack and release times.
- The action is shown on the main meter bridge:
  - The **MIC COMPRESSOR** indicator shows the applied reduction in decibels.
