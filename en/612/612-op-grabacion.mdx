## Program Recording

D612 consoles feature two stereo output channels:

- **PGM (Program):** main on-air output.
- **REC (Recording):** dedicated recording output, independent from PGM.

This allows recording material while simultaneously broadcasting different content on-air.

<Note>
  The hybrid channel is **on-air only** and cannot be assigned to the REC channel.
</Note>

## PC Recording

PGM and REC outputs are also available in digital format via USB.\
In Windows®, it appears as:

- **USB Recording Device:** corresponds to Channel 5 and carries **PGM or REC** signal, depending on the channel's **OUT** switch position.

### Configuration

- **On PC:** configure the recording software to use the **USB Recording Device**.
- **On console:** on Channel 5, set the **OUT** switch to PGM position to record the on-air broadcast, or to **REC** for sources not on-air.

<Accordion title="EXAMPLE: Recording voices while broadcasting" icon="microphone" iconType="solid">
  1. In the monitoring section:

  - Assign control speakers to **REC** mix.
  - If monitor signal needs to be sent to announcers, also assign REC to Studio.

  2. Assign required channels for recording to **REC** (e.g., MIC-1).
  3. Keep musical programming on-air from Channel-5 (USB), assigned to **PGM** and not REC.

  <Note>
    Channel 5 can be used for audio playback **independently** of the output assignment (PGM or REC).
  </Note>
  **Recording process**

  - Raise the corresponding microphone channel fader.
  - Check levels in the recording software.
  - Adjust level using the console channel faders (not from software).

  <Danger>
    The **USB-1** recording device has no software input level control (Windows Mixer). Adjustment is only done from the console.
  </Danger>
  Announcers monitor the recording through headphones or speakers.

  After finishing, the recording can be played back from an analog PC output connected to the console, different from the USB output (since in this example USB output is used for broadcasting).

  To check the recording:

  - Use the **REC** bus (as PGM is being used on-air).
  - Assign the channel connected to PC's analog output to REC.

  When work is complete, restore all controls to their original position to return to normal mode.

## Recording Phone Lines

The internal hybrid sends signal only to **PGM**.\
Therefore, telephone communications can only be recorded while they are on-air, using the PGM send to the PC.
