## Power Supply

On the left side (viewed from rear) is the **DC IN** power connector, a tubular connector with 1.8 mm positive pin.

The power supply included with the console is a **90-240V switching power supply**, capable of operating with any power grid and tolerating large voltage variations.\
It delivers regulated **28 VDC**.

<Danger>
  It is recommended to **use only the power supply provided by Solidyne**.
</Danger>

The D612 console **does not have a power switch**: it remains powered while connected to the power supply and electrical network.

## Ground Connection

The ground connection is made through a **brass terminal** that ensures chassis grounding. Use **2 mm** gauge wire connected to a **buried copper ground rod**.
