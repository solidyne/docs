UX18 allows configuring its outputs to use the **AUX** input of StudioBox units with separate talkback circuits. This way, the operator can talk privately to a group of headphones, or to all participants.

The diagram shows the connection and configuration of **StudioBox HD5** with dual talkback channel on a UNIDEX UX-18.\
For **StudioBox HD3**, the connection is the same.

### Connection

- The **STUDIO MONITOR** input of the StudioBox connects to the **STUDIO MONITOR** output on the console, using a pin-to-pin STP RJ45 to RJ45 cable (SOL P25 or P50 cables).
- The **AUX-IN** input of StudioBox connects to an **assignable output** on the console (OUT1 to OUT4) using a pin-to-pin STP RJ45 to RJ45 cable (SOL P25 or P50 cables).

### Configuration

- On StudioBox, assign one or more headphones to the **AUX** input.
- On UX18, the output connected to AUX IN is configured as follows (see SETTINGS → OUTPUTS):
  - **Source:** `STUDIO`. The output signal follows the assignment made in the _MONITOR_ screen.
  - **Talk-Back Ch:** Select a channel (or group) to link it to the output.\
    When activating Talk-Back on that channel, the signal will be sent through this output to the headphones assigned to **AUX IN**.\
    For example: to talk privately to _MIC-1_ headphones, "Talk-Back Ch" will be assigned to the MIC-1 channel.
  - **Studio Talk-Back link:** `Enabled`.

### Operation

- With the above configuration, all headphones hear the signal assigned on the console for Studio monitoring (MONITOR screen).
- The **main Talk-Back button** allows talking to all headphones through the talkback microphone.
- The **CUE/SELECT button** of the linked channel or group allows talking **only** to the headphones assigned to AUX.\
  To do this, press and hold **CUE/SELECT** on the channel.\
  The channel display will show `TLBK`.
