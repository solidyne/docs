The user and scene management screen allows:

- Changing the current scene
- Using advanced channel organization functions

Access it by pressing the **SCENES** option, available in the contextual buttons when the console shows the **main screen**.

## USERS

The **USER LOGIN** area (1) shows the currently active user and allows switching to another user by touching the corresponding option.\
There are **three user levels** with different preset permissions. Restrictions apply both to console screen operation and remote web interface.

### BASIC User

Most restricted profile:

- No password protection
- No access to advanced configuration options (SETTINGS)
- Can change scenes but cannot save changes or create new scenes
- Can view processor settings and status but cannot modify or turn them on/off
- Can temporarily modify basic channel options (**GAIN**, **NAME**, **PAN**, **CHANNEL ACTIONS**) but cannot save changes to the scene

### EXPERT User

Profile with intermediate restrictions:

- Password protected (default: `expert`). Only ADMIN user can change it
- Like BASIC, no access to advanced configuration (SETTINGS)
- Full access to audio processing
- In **CHANNEL** screen can change **gain**, **pan**, **name**, **input assignment** and **channel mode**, but cannot access SETTINGS
- Can save current scene, except if protected
- Can create new scenes, even from a protected one

### ADMIN User

Profile with full access:

- Password protected (default: `admin`). Can change all passwords from **SETTINGS** screen
- Can create protected or read-only scenes that are operational for BASIC and EXPERT but only editable by ADMIN

<Note>
  Passwords are defined in the **SETTINGS - USERS** screen.
</Note>

#### Startup User

On power up, the console starts with a predefined user profile (factory default: ADMIN) and never requests password.

In **SETTINGS → USERS** you can:

- Change the startup user
- **Change passwords** for ADMIN and EXPERT

## SCENES

A **scene** stores all console configuration, except system settings (network, streaming, startup user, etc.). It includes:

- Input and output configuration
- Channel and bus assignments
- Gains
- Audio processor settings

Scenes allow quickly loading a preset configuration according to each show's requirements; for example, reassigning inputs, changing channel order or adjusting microphone processors.

<Warning>
  The scene must be saved after modifying any parameter (gain, equalizer, channel name, etc.) for the change to be permanently stored.
</Warning>

### Available Scenes

The list (see 2 in image) shows 12 user scenes.

- Navigate by turning the encoder and confirm by pressing it
- Active scene is highlighted in **light blue**
- Selected scene (but not confirmed) is highlighted in **orange**

### Protected Scenes (Lock)

- Only **ADMIN** profile can create them
- Identified with a padlock icon
- BASIC and EXPERT users can load them but cannot modify or delete them

### Scene Manager

Presents two option groups: for the **selected scene** and for the **active scene**.

**LOAD**: Loads the selected scene. Can be done from touchscreen, contextual button or encoder.

- Requires confirmation (cancels after 8 seconds if not confirmed)
- All profiles can load any scene
- If channels are on-air, they remain active even if position changes, maintaining bus assignments
- If the new assigned channel has a different fader level, previous digital level is maintained and indicated by flashing OLED
- **Audio cuts if previously on-air input is not assigned** to a channel in new scene
- Cannot change scenes with telephone line on-air or on hold

**RENAME**: Changes selected scene name.

- Disabled for BASIC

**COPY CURRENT**: Copies active scene over selected scene.

- Requires confirmation
- Disabled for BASIC

**SET TO DEFAULT**: Restores active scene to factory configuration.

- Disabled for BASIC

**SAVE**: Saves current configuration of:

- Input assignment to 24 channels
- Signal assignment to outputs
- Specific input/output configuration (phantom, MIX-MINUS modes, etc.)
- Input and output gains
- Channel labels and actions
- Audio processor settings
- Assignment status, including VBUS

<Warning>
  Scene does **not save** status of **ON-AIR** or **CUE** buttons.
</Warning>

### Factory Scenes

Any of the 12 scenes can be reset to a default configuration. Additionally, UNIDEX comes from factory with scenes designed with different configurations and UDX expansions, intended as base or example for creating new configurations.

### Export and Import Scenes

Scenes can be exported and imported from the **WEB control interface**.\
From the scene management option in web control, each scene can be exported as a disk file. And later imported into any of the 12 available positions.

## Channel Map

The **CHANNEL MAP** function shows all channel configuration and allows easy reordering.\
There are two operation modes: **SWAP 2 CH** (swap two channels) and **ORDER CH** (reorganize channels).

### SWAP 2 CH

Allows swapping position of two channels.

   - **APPLY** applies changes temporarily (not saved yet)
   - Changes are lost if scene is abandoned without saving
4. Press **SAVE** for changes to be permanent in scene
5. To cancel, deactivate **ORDER CH** by touching option again or press **BACK** contextual button
