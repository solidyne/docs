## Monitoring Section

The monitoring section consists of:

- **Level controls** for speakers, headphones and CUE located on the console surface.
- The **MONITOR screen** for signal assignment.

## MONITOR Screen

MONITOR is accessed by pressing the quick access button located to the right of the screen. This screen assigns the audio sources that will be heard through the studio and control room monitor speakers and headphones.

<Note>
  Assignment is done by simply touching each option. The selected option is highlighted in light blue.
</Note>

### STUDIO (Studio Monitoring)

Selects the source sent to the **STUDIO MONITOR** output.\
Options: `AIR-IN`, `PGM`, `REC`, `AUX`, `VBUS`, `CUE`.

- The level for studio speakers and headphones is adjusted from the **\+ADVANCED** option. Usually this level remains fixed and each participant adjusts their own level from a headphone distribution amplifier.
- In single-room radio stations, monitor speakers can be connected to the **Control Room** output to take advantage of the physical volume knob.

### CONTROL ROOM (Control Room Monitoring)

Selects the source sent to the **CONTROL ROOM** speakers and headphones.\
Options: `ONAIR-IN`, `PGM`, `REC`, `AUX`, `VBUS`.

<Note>
  **Control Room Speaker Muting:**\
  When using a microphone in the Control Room, the control room speaker output can be configured to mute when activated (see _Channel Screen_).\
  This is also used in single-studio or "hot cabin" stations by connecting the monitoring speakers to the **Control Room** output and configuring all microphones as "located in Control Room" to enable automatic muting.
</Note>

The **CUE SUM** SPEAKER and PHONES buttons allow injecting the CUE signal into the Control Room monitors and/or headphones.

- When active, the CUE signal is summed with the monitored signal.
- The main signal is automatically attenuated when a CUE signal enters.
- The attenuation level is configured in the **\+ADVANCED** screen.

The CUE bus can be assigned to any output for auxiliary speaker connection. By default, it is assigned to **OUTPUT 4**.

#### CUE Level

The screen shows a dBfs-calibrated meter that reflects the level after the CUE control. If the attenuator is closed, there will be no indication.

**CUE RESET**\
Turns off all active CUE buttons on the console.

### MONITOR: \+ADVANCED

Shows level controls and advanced settings for monitoring signals.

<Note>
  To change a value, touch the control and turn the encoder. Press the encoder to confirm.
</Note>

**Studio Speaker**\
Adjusts the signal level for speakers connected to the **Studio Monitor** output.\
The output is line level, designed for active speakers.

**Studio Headphones**\
Adjusts the signal level for headphones connected to the **Studio Monitor** output.\
It is designed to feed a headphone distribution amplifier.

<Warning>
  **Note on monitoring levels:**\
  The level of the Studio speaker and headphone outputs should be adjusted to avoid excessive amplification in active monitors or headphone distributors.\
  If the console signal is too low and is amplified later, the signal-to-noise ratio degrades.
</Warning>

**ON-AIR Input Gain**\
Controls the gain of the **Air Monitor Input** (external tuner).

**RING Level**\
Level of the "ring" tone in **CUE**, generated by the console when a call comes in through landline or Bluetooth.

**Talk-Back Mic Level**\
Adjusts the level of the talk-back microphone to Studio monitoring, Intercom and telephone lines.

**Talk-Back Mic Source**\
Defines the microphone input used for talk-back (Studios, TELCO and Intercom).\
Options:

- Built-in ambient microphone.
- Microphone inputs 1 to 4.
- UNIDEX-4 L and UNIDEX-4 R.
- DANTE #1 (when available)

The input assigned to talk-back can also be assigned to a channel, for example, to put that microphone on-air.

**Control Room CUE Sum Audio Att**\
Sets the attenuation of the signal being monitored in the Control Room when a CUE signal overlaps in speakers and/or headphones.\
This attenuation also applies when activating a talk-back button (to studios or telephone line) or an Intercom.

### MASTER ON-AIR MICS (1)

Simultaneously activates/deactivates all microphone channels and groups assigned to the MASTER button.

### Control Room Monitor Level (2)

Rotary attenuator that adjusts the level of speakers connected to the **Control Room** output.\
The output is line level for active (powered) speakers. The maximum level achieved will also depend on the monitors' own settings.

### Control Room Headphone Level (3)

Rotary attenuator for the operator's headphone level (connected to **Control Room Headphones**).

### CUE Level (4)

A rotary attenuator that controls the CUE bus level. The main screen shows a CUE level meter, calibrated in dBfs. The meter shows the output level after the CUE level control; therefore, there will be no indication if the CUE attenuator is closed.

### Talk-Back Button and Microphone

When pressing this button, the Talk-Back microphone is sent to the STUDIO output (speakers and headphones). In headphones, Talk-Back is reproduced through the left channel while maintaining the program signal (or other assigned signal) in the right channel.
