## Main Screen

### Level Meters

The **PGM**, **REC**, **AUX** and **VBUS** meters display:

- Average level in **VU** (slow-moving blue bar).
- Peak level in **dBfs** (floating yellow segment).

The scale is calibrated in dBfs, where **-20 dBfs equals 0 VU**.\
The numerical value on the right shows the current maximum (in VU or dBfs) and toggles by touching the number.\
The main meter remains visible on all screens and can be switched between buses by touching the bus name on the left.

<Tip>
  **Note about levels:**\
  The meters show the **bus** level.

  - On digital outputs, the level matches the output level if gain is at 0.
  - On analog outputs, 0 VU = -20 dBfs, with nominal levels of **+4 dBu** (balanced) and **0 dBu** (unbalanced).\
    If a gain level higher than nominal is set, headroom is reduced and clipping may occur before the meter shows it.
