## Channels

UNIDEX UX18 has 18 channels:

- **10 channels** with 100mm faders and **8 "virtual channels"** operated from the touchscreen or remote web interface.
- 4 channels can work as **groups**, to control **virtual channel submixes** from mechanical faders.
- Each channel can be assigned to any input.
- Channels can be configured in three modes: **MIC**, **LINE** or **TELCO**, which modifies their behavior and functions.
- They can be assigned to four stereo mix buses: **PGM**, **REC**, **AUX** and **VBUS**.

## Inputs

UX18 features 5 microphone inputs and 13 line inputs (analog and digital).
