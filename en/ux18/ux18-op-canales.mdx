## Physical Channels

The **UNIDEX UX18** console features 18 channels. The main console panel has 10 channels with 100mm soft-touch faders.\
The other 8 channels can be operated from the **touchscreen** or remotely via web.

### 1 <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} />  Buses

The signal in each channel can be assigned to 4 mix buses: **PGM**, **REC**, **AUX** and **VBUS**.

- For channels 1 to 6, assignment to PGM, REC and AUX is done through three quick access buttons. When the channel is assigned, the button lights up orange.
- Channels 7 to 18 are assigned to output buses by accessing the CHANNEL screen or VIRTUAL CHANNELS from the main screen. When a channel is assigned to a group, it inherits the group's bus assignments.
- For all channels, VBUS assignment is done from the CHANNEL screen or web control.

### 2 <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} />  CUE/SELECT Button

Serves three functions:

- **CUE:** Pre-fader listening. Allows monitoring the signal present in the channel before the fader and ON-AIR button.
- **SELECT:** Channel selection for settings and configuration.
- **TALKBACK:** TALK-BACK mode is used for communications (TELCO and USB channels assigned to call software) and to generate a second talkback channel to the Studio. Holding CUE activates the talk-back microphone.

#### 3 <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} />  ON-AIR Button

Activates the channel.\
When on, the signal is sent to the assigned buses according to the fader level.

#### 4 <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} />  OLED Display

Shows:

- Pre-fader signal level. The **CLIP** indication shows when input signal reaches 0 dBfs and requires gain reduction.
- Channel name or label.
- Status in special modes like SELECT or TELCO.

  <Note>
    **About OLED brightness**\
    Brightness reduces after 5 minutes of inactivity and turns off after 15 minutes.\
    Any control action reactivates the display.
  </Note>

#### 5 <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} />  Main Fader

Controls signal level in the mix buses.\
If the level is modified from the CHANNEL screen or remotely via web, the actual attenuation value may not match the physical fader position (non-motorized). In this case, the OLED display flashes showing the current value.\
Moving the fader progressively synchronizes the value.

## Groups and Submixes

The **UX18** console features **4 GROUP faders**.\
Each group can have one or more **virtual channels** assigned (channels 7 to 18).

**Behavior**

- **Single channel assigned** → the group behaves as another channel, giving the virtual channel physical controls (fader, **ON-AIR** and **CUE** buttons).
- **Two or more channels assigned** → the group works as a **sub-master**, controlling a **submix** of those virtual channels.
- Group channels can be linked to the **MASTER ON-AIR MIC** button from the **CHANNEL** screen.

  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"37%" }}
/>

### Controls and GROUPS Screen

- **Physical**: fader, ON-AIR, CUE.
- **GROUPS screen**: Accessed by pressing the GROUPS quick access button. Allows managing bus assignments and submixes.

<img

  alt="UX18 - Groups Screen"
  title="UX18 - Groups Screen"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"60%" }}
/>

The GROUPS screen initially shows:

- **Bus assignment:** allows output assignment for each group. All **channels** linked to the group **inherit** this assignment.
- **Essential information:** Allows working with the GROUPS screen while keeping track of: program level, current time, timer and microphones "on-air" indication.
- Pressing **MIX** at the bottom of each group accesses the **submix screen** for channels assigned to that group.

  <img
    src="/images/ux24/ux18-GROUPS_MIX.png"
    alt="UX18 GROUPS MIX"
    title="UX18 GROUPS MIX"
    className="mx-auto"
    style={{ width:"65%" }}
  />
- Group submixes are **saved in the scene**.

### Assigning Channels to a Group

Virtual channels can be assigned to a group in two ways:

1. From the **CHANNEL MAP** wizard, accessible from the **SCENES** screen or by pressing **ADD** in the group submix view.
2. From the **CHANNEL** screen, accessible from the main screen.

<Note>
  Assigning or removing channels from a group requires **ADMIN** profile access.

  Group configuration is saved in the scene.
</Note>

## The SELECT Function

**SELECT** mode temporarily converts the **CUE** buttons into channel selection buttons.\
When active, CUE buttons light up blue and channel OLED displays show the SELECT text.

This function is used to choose a channel and view or adjust its settings. For example, to adjust an equalizer, you must first select the channel to view its controls.

In SELECT mode you can select a group. In this case, information about the channels assigned to the group will be displayed.

### Activating SELECT Mode

SELECT mode is activated in any of these situations:

- By pressing **CHANNEL** on the main screen.
- By pressing **PROCESS** on the main screen.
- By pressing **SELECT** on the CHANNEL screen or a process screen (EQ, compressor, etc.).

When SELECT mode is active, you can choose a channel in two ways:

1. **MODE A**\
   Pressing a CUE/SELECT button displays the channel on screen. SELECT mode remains active, allowing other channels to be selected (this makes it easy to compare/review channels). The CUE/SELECT button of the currently selected channel keeps flashing.
2. **MODE B**\
   Turning the encoder to scroll through channels. The encoder scrolls through all 24 channels, whether physical or virtual.

To confirm channel selection, press the SELECT button on screen or press the encoder. It also confirms if you touch a channel control on screen.
Upon confirmation, SELECT mode deactivates and CUE/SELECT buttons return to their normal operation mode (CUE).

## "Virtual" Channels

UNIDEX UX18 handles 8 channels **from the touchscreen**.\
**VIRTUAL MIXER** allows controlling all functions of these channels. When one or more virtual channels are on air, the **VIRTUAL** indication on the main screen **flashes red** to indicate this condition.

<Tip>
  **Pressing the encoder** on the main screen accesses the channel mixer, which displays in two 6-channel screens.
</Tip>

To facilitate touch operation, virtual channel controls are divided into two screens.

The **LEVEL** screen shows faders and ON AIR activation buttons.

### VIRTUAL MIXER and Group-Assigned Channels

Virtual channels can be assigned to group submixes. There are four group channels, each identified by a color. Channels assigned to a group are shown in VIRTUAL MIXER with **the corresponding group color**.

Output bus **assignments** are locked in the channel, as grouped channels inherit the group's assignment.

The power button of a grouped channel changes from **ON AIR to ON/OFF**, since putting the channel on air depends on group activation.

## Channel Screen (CHANNEL)

The **channel screen** shows all values and settings associated with a channel.\
It includes basic functions, like input gain adjustment, and advanced options requiring special permissions.

#### Accessing the Channel Screen

1. **From the main screen**, press the **CHANNEL** option.

   This will open the screen on the last selected channel and activate **SELECT mode**.\
   In the menu, the CHANNEL option will change to SELECT to allow activating or deactivating it.
2. **Select a channel**:\
   With **SELECT** active, the **CUE/SELECT** buttons allow choosing a channel. While selection mode is active, you can alternate between different channels to compare their settings.
   - **Virtual channels** are selected by turning the **encoder**, which scrolls through all 18 channels.
   - On screen, the channel name area shows in **light blue** for physical channels and **purple** for virtual channels.
   - When selecting a **GROUP**, the screen shows a list of channels assigned to that group. Touching a channel in the list accesses that channel's screen.
3. **Exit SELECT mode**:\
   To confirm and exit, press the **SELECT** button on screen or press the **encoder**.\
   Selection mode also cancels automatically when modifying any parameter on the selected channel.

### CHANNEL Screen Elements

#### 1 <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} />  VU Meter

Level indicator visible on all screens.\
Shows the level of a mix bus, usually **PROGRAM**, in VU scale with peak hold.

- Touching the PGM label allows changing to show AUX, REC or VBUS.
- The number on the right indicates the maximum value, in VU or dBfs. Touching the number toggles between units. The VU/dBfs unit change applies to all screens.

#### 2 <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Balance

Adjusts left/right channel relationship for stereo inputs.\
Acts as pan-pot for mono inputs.\
To change the value, touch the control and turn the encoder. Press encoder to confirm.

#### 3 <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Channel Level

Represents the physical fader and modifies signal level in buses.\
For channels with mechanical faders, the on-screen value reflects physical position. If level is modified from screen, the actual value changes but physical fader doesn't move (non-motorized). In this case, channel's OLED display flashes the current value to indicate it differs from physical fader position.

<Note>
  Output levels may differ from meter readings due to output gain compensation. Matching occurs only when output is set to nominal level (4 dBu for analog outputs).
</Note>

#### 4 <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Buses

Show channel assignments to mix buses.

- For physical channels reflect PGM, REC and AUX buttons.
- For virtual channels allow assignment to any bus.
- Both allow assigning channel to **VBUS**, which has no hardware assignment button.

Activation/deactivation is done from touchscreen and, for physical channels, is also reflected on mechanical buttons.

### 5 <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Name

Allows assigning a name up to 10 characters. For physical channels shows on channel's OLED display.\
Touching the name opens a text editing window.

#### 6 <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Input Config

Includes gain control and assigned input information.

- ADMIN profile: full configuration access by touching SETTINGS or reassignment from dropdown menu.
- **Gain**: adjustment in decibels via touchscreen and encoder.

#### 7 <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Mode

Defines channel behavior according to signal type:

- **LINE**: for any source other than microphones and communications.
- **MIC**: for microphone signals, whether onboard inputs, external UDX adapters or third-party preamps connected to line inputs.
- **TELCO**: for communications (landlines, VoIP, Bluetooth cellphones), controlling compatible UNIDEX adapters from TELCO screen.

#### 8 <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Channel Actions

Specific functions according to channel **MODE**.

- **CUE SOLO**: when activating CUE on channel, turns off CUE on other channels with this option active.\
  Channels without CUE SOLO active are unaffected, allowing CUE to be on in multiple channels simultaneously.\
  If all channels work in CUE SOLO mode, there will be only one CUE on. A common configuration is using CUE SOLO mode on lines (computers and audio players) and normal mode on microphones and TELCO channels.
- **CUE AUTO OFF**: automatically turns off CUE when putting channel on air.

**Actions for MIC mode channels:**

- **MASTER MIC A/B**: assigns channel to one or both master buttons.
- **STUDIO A/B**: associates channel with signaling for one of the studios.
- **CTRL ROOM MIC**: mutes Control Room speakers (not Studio) when putting channel on air.

#### 9 <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Process

Shows available processors on assigned input and their status (active/inactive).

- On/off by touching name (except BASIC profile).
- Settings editing from EDIT (ADMIN profile only).

  <Note>
    Available processes aren't channel-specific, but depend on assigned inputs.
  </Note>

#### 10 <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" iconType="solid" color="#ffa300" size={18} /> Output Routing

Indicates if channel is associated with a direct output (e.g. UNIDEX adapters for TELCO lines).\
Routing configuration is accessible in ADMIN profile from SETTINGS.
