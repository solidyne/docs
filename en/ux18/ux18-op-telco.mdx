The TELCO screen manages and broadcasts all types of telephone communications. \
Access it by pressing **TELCO** on the main screen.\
It displays channels defined in TELCO mode (see CHANNEL screen), which are those associated with landline phones (POTS) and Bluetooth mobile phones.

In these instructions, the term "TELCO line" refers to both traditional lines and paired mobile phones.

<Note>
  Landlines (POTS) and mobile phones connect to UNIDEX through external adapters (Solidyne UDX 2TEL and TEL+BT).
</Note>

Calls, whether through traditional telephony or Bluetooth mobiles, are operated the same way on the console, except for some specific features (for example, when originating a call).

**Each line uses its own channel.** Any channel can be configured in TELCO mode, though using physical channels is recommended.

Main operations (answer, hold, broadcast, hang up) can also be performed using the **CUE** and **ON AIR** buttons on each channel.

### TELCO Screen

**Available Lines (1)**\
UX24 supports up to 8 TELCO lines. The screen displays them in two groups of four lines.\
If there are more than four, the **Page Down** button accesses the remaining ones. Each line indicates:

- Channel number and name.
- Status:

  **Yellow**: incoming call (_RING_).

  **Green**: line on hold (_HOLD_).

  **Red**: line on air.
- Time on air or on hold.

**Selected Line (2)**\
Shows name and channel of currently selected line. On-screen controls always correspond to this line.\
To select a line, touch it in the list. It doesn't matter if it's on air, on hold, or inactive.

**Level Indicator (3)**\
Shows received audio level. Also indicates the name of the UNIDEX input where the UDX adapter was connected.

**Input Gain (4)**\
Controls input gain associated with the UDX adapter. Adjusted by touching the control and turning the encoder.

**Send Level (5)**\
Adjusts the gain of the output associated with the UDX adapter for line send. Adjusted by touching the control and turning the encoder.

**TALK (6)**\
Activates Talkback mode, enabling the talkback microphone to speak to the line. Equivalent to holding the CUE button on the channel, but unlike CUE, screen TALK doesn't operate with pushbutton logic, but **acts as a switch**: activated with one touch and deactivated with a second touch. It also deactivates when the line goes on air.

<Note>
  While TALK is active, whether by pressing CUE or enabled on screen, PGM signal to the line is interrupted, only the talkback microphone is sent.
</Note>

**DIAL (7)**\
Opens a DTMF keypad for dialing (landlines only).

**HOLD / HANG UP (8)**

- With incoming call: takes the line and puts it on hold (HOLD).
- With call on air: ends communication (HANG UP).

**CONFIG (9)**\
Shows adapter type and options:

- **NULL ADJUST**: rejection adjustment (only for landlines with UDX 2TEL, 2TEL-P and TEL+BL adapters). Adjustment is done manually from the UDX interface.
- **BLUETOOTH PAIRING**: activates pairing mode to link a mobile (Bluetooth channels only).
