## Streaming services overview

UX18 consoles can generate **two independent audio streams** and decode one incoming audio stream.

- **Stream 1 (outgoing)**\
  Uses **RTP** protocol, ideal for transmitter site link (**STL**).
- **Stream 2 (outgoing)**\
  Compatible with **Shoutcast/Icecast** servers for internet broadcasting.
- **Stream 3 (incoming)**\
  Can be **RTP** or **public HTTP streaming**.\
  When enabled, the received audio is **automatically decoded and switched** replacing the **AES-1** input.
- **Remote monitoring:** UX18 includes a **WebRTC service** that allows remote audio monitoring from the **Web Control Interface**, both locally and externally via Internet.

## Streaming services configuration

Access through **SETTINGS** screen, under **STREAMING** option. Requires ADMIN profile.\
STREAMING opens the Streaming Interface Access screen.

Shows a **summary of audio transmission and reception streams status**, and allows access to other configuration instances:

- **STREAM CFG** → Access to streaming services configuration.
- **SYSTEM** → Access to LAN configuration for UX18 streaming services\
  (not to be confused with WEB remote control LAN configuration).

### UP-STREAM (TX) - Icecast/Shoutcast

The **UP-STREAM** tab allows configuring an **Icecast** or **Shoutcast** broadcast server to publish the program signal.

- **RUN/STOP**: Enables or disables streaming transmission when changes are confirmed by pressing **APPLY**.

  <Tip>
    To optimize system resources, keep stopped when service is not in use.
  </Tip>
- **PROTOCOL**: Defines if server is Icecast or Shoutcast type.
- **SERVER IP**: Server destination IP address.
- **PORT**: Server TCP listening port.
- **MOUNTPOINT**: Unique name that identifies the stream on the server.
- **Stream NAME**: Name that identifies the stream.
- **PASSWORD**: Access password for publishing (if applicable).
- **CODEC**: Transmission audio format (Opus or MP3).
- **QUALITY**: Encoding bitrate
- **APPLY**: Applies and saves changes and starts or stops transmission (according to RUN/STOP status).

<Note>
  Configuration parameters for Icecast/Shoutcast are provided by the server provider.
</Note>

### Audio processing for streaming

Clicking the **PROCESS** icon accesses the audio processor, which includes **level normalization** and **bass enhancement**. This processing only affects **Icecast/Shoutcast** _streaming_.

/>

#### Normalizer

Reduces signal dynamics and adjusts level to a constant value, achieving more consistent sound without volume jumps.

- **Target LUFS**: Determines streaming signal target level (± 1 LU).\
  Adjusted according to content type:
  - **-21 to -19 LU** → Signals with large level variation, without previous control (example: uncompressed microphones).
  - **-18 to -15 LU** → Mixed signals of music and speech, using compressors on microphone channels to limit dynamics.
  - **-14 to -12 LU** → Already heavily compressed signals (music).
- **Style**: Defines normalizer action times.\
  Possible values: _slow_, _normal_, _fast_.
  - _Slow_: recommended when there are large volume variations.
  - _Fast_: useful for normalizing previously compressed signals.

#### Bass Boost

Applies bass enhancement to the _streaming_ signal.

- **FREQ.** → Cutoff frequency; enhancement is applied below it.
- **ACTION** → Adjusts the degree of enhancement applied.

<Tip>
  **Recommendation**: use _Bass Boost_ in speech-focused broadcasts to obtain voices with greater bass impact.
</Tip>

### RTP LINK

The **RTP LINK** tab allows configuring streaming transmission to a specific IP address, for example, to send the program signal to a transmitter site (**STL**).

<Warning>
  Implementing an RTP link requires advanced network configuration knowledge.
</Warning>

<img

  alt="UX18 RTP Link"
  title="UX18 RTP Link"
  style={{ width:"62%" }}
/>

- **ENABLE/DISABLED**: Enables or disables RTP streaming when changes are confirmed by pressing **APPLY**.

  <Tip>
    To optimize system resources, keep stopped when service is not in use.
  </Tip>
- **DESTINATION ADDRESS**: Destination IP address.
- **PORT**: TCP transmission port.
- **CODEC**: Audio format for RTP (**PCM** / **MP3**).
- **QUALITY**: MP3 bitrate or PCM sampling rate.
- **GPO**: Enables sending **on-air light (Tally Light)** signals via TCP/IP for compatible Solidyne equipment.
  - **Studio A and B** (lines 1 and 2 respectively)
  - **Studio B and A** (reversed order)
  - **A\+B** (signal activates on both lines, regardless of active studio)

### Down-Stream (RX)

Allows configuring an incoming stream. When **DOWN-STREAM** module is activated, the decoded audio is internally routed to **AES-1** input, which changes its name to **STREAM-1**.\
In this mode, the rear panel AES-1 connector is disabled.

- **RUN/STOP**\
  Starts or stops streaming decoding when changes are confirmed with **APPLY**.

  <Tip>
    To optimize system resources, keep stopped when service is not in use.
  </Tip>
- **PROTOCOL**\
  Defines incoming _streaming_ type. The following formats are supported:
  - Public **HTTP** and **MMS** streams encoded in PCM 16 (44.1/48 kHz), MP3 or Opus.
  - **RTP** streams in PCM 16 (44.1 kHz) and MP3.
- **SERVER URL/IP**\
  Name or IP address of server generating the _stream_.
- **PORT**\
  TCP port where _streaming_ enters.\
  Default value: **0**.
- **MOUNTPOINT**\
  Unique name that identifies the _stream_.
- **APPLY**\
  Applies configuration changes.

### REMOTE PLAYER

The **Web Remote Control Interface** allows listening to console audio through a **WebRTC** service.

#### Audio Format

- Encoding: **Opus**
- Configurable bitrate: **128 to 320 kbps**

#### Local network operation

When accessing from a **LAN** terminal, no advanced configurations are required.\
The remote player will play audio directly through the local network.

#### Internet operation

To access audio from the **Web Control Interface** through the Internet, the network must implement:

- **Symmetric NAT**
- **TURN server**

> If these services are not available, a warning message will appear in the player.

### SERVICES CFG

The **Services Configuration** screen allows assigning audio sources to streaming services.

| Service      | Assigned audio source                                                                    | Additional configuration                                |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **STREAM-1** | **Program** signal present at **AES3-1 PGM** output                                     | Adjustable level in `SETTINGS → OUTPUTS → AES-1/STREAM-1` |
| **STREAM-2** | Can be assigned to **PGM**, **REC**, **AUX**, **VBUS**, **STUDIO**, **CUE** or **Talk-Back** | Configurable in `SETTINGS → OUTPUTS → STREAM-2`          |

#### Operational notes

- The **ENABLE** column allows starting or stopping each service.
- It is recommended to **keep stopped** services that are not in use to optimize system resources.

### Streaming System

General network settings for **UX18 Streamer** module (not to be confused with web control access).
