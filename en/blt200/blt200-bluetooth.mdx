## General concepts

Any mobile phone can connect to BLT200 via Bluetooth.\
The interface has two Bluetooth devices labeled **A** and **B**.

/>

Each channel has its own rotary output level control.\
On the phone, Bluetooth volume should always be set to maximum for the best signal-to-noise ratio (see below).

The **CONTROL A** and **CONTROL B** buttons are illuminated and flash at different patterns depending on the Bluetooth status.

### CONTROL button lighting modes

| Mode | Status                                                      | Indication                                                                                    |
| :--: | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A    | Mobile connected (no active call)                            | Brief yellow ON (1s), long OFF (2s).                                                          |
| B    | Call in progress / Mobile not connected (Bluetooth ON unpaired) | Slow yellow ON (2s), short OFF (1s). Returns to mode A when a mobile connects.               |
| C    | Search mode (Pairing)                                       | Fast yellow flashing.                                                                        |
| D    | Incoming call                                               | Solid blue.                                                                                  |

<Info>
  Do not confuse these three actions:

  - **Enable/disable Bluetooth on mobile**: enables or disables the phone's Bluetooth system.
  - **Pairing**: the mobile detects and registers an external device for the first time (e.g.: headphones, hands-free, BLT200 channel A or B).
  - **Connect/disconnect**: the mobile connects to an already paired device. This action does not require re-pairing.\
    When Bluetooth is enabled on the mobile, it can easily connect or disconnect from paired devices through the registered devices list.\
    Devices not previously paired will not appear in that list.

## Pairing a mobile with BLT200

To pair a Bluetooth channel with a mobile, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Turn off Bluetooth on BLT200">
    Verify that the channel you want to pair (A or B) is off.\
    If the CONTROL button is flashing, press and hold until it turns off.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate pairing mode">
    From Bluetooth off, press and hold the CONTROL button for about 8 seconds.\
    The light will change from slow to fast yellow flashing.\
    This indicates the channel has entered **Pairing** mode.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search for devices from mobile">
    On the phone, enable Bluetooth and search for new devices.\
    This procedure may vary depending on the mobile model.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the device">
    **Solidyne BLT-A** and **Solidyne BLT-B** will appear.\
    Select the corresponding one according to the channel to be used.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  On the mobile, it's possible to change the name "Solidyne BLT-A" or "Solidyne BLT-B" to better differentiate channels or BLT200 units in use.
</Tip>

Once paired, the CONTROL button flashes slowly in yellow (connected mode without call).\
The pairing is maintained while using the same mobile on that channel.\
To pair another mobile or the same one on the other channel, repeat the procedure.

<Warning>
  A single mobile can be paired to both A and B channels, but can only be **connected** to one of them at a time.\
  It's also not possible to simultaneously connect two mobiles to the same channel.
</Warning>

### Distance to mobile

Although the range is up to 3 meters, it's recommended to keep the phone close to the interface, but never placed directly on top of the BLT200.

## Re-connecting a previously paired mobile

A previously paired mobile can disconnect from BLT200 in several situations:

- **If Bluetooth is turned off on the mobile.**\
  This normally transfers the ongoing call to the phone.\
  When turning Bluetooth back on, reconnection can be automatic or manual depending on the model.
- **If during a call the Bluetooth channel is disconnected on the phone.**\
  The call transfers to the phone.\
  Upon reconnecting, it returns to BLT200.
- **If "Speaker" mode is activated on the phone.**\
  This removes the call from BLT200 and transfers it to the phone.\
  When reactivating Bluetooth, the call returns to BLT200.
- **If the Bluetooth channel is turned off on BLT200.**

Reconnection will not be possible if that channel was paired with another phone and the latter is connected.

## Volume adjustment

<Warning>
  On the phone, Bluetooth volume should always be set to maximum to ensure proper reception and the best signal-to-noise ratio.
</Warning>

The adjustment must be made during an established Bluetooth call.\
The phone's speaker volume is independent of Bluetooth volume: if adjusted outside a call, it only modifies the speaker, not the Bluetooth transmission.

The Bluetooth level is stored in the phone.\
If a new mobile is paired, make sure to readjust the volume to maximum.

## Turning off Bluetooth on BLT200

To turn off a Bluetooth channel, press and hold the corresponding CONTROL button until it stops flashing.
