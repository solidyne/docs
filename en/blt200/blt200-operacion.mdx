The following guidelines describe the procedure to obtain audio from mobile phones through the BLT200 audio output.\
On-air operation will depend on the console being used and the configured [connection scheme](/es/blt200/blt200-conexiones).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Turn on Bluetooth channel on BLT200">
    Press and hold the **CONTROL A** or **CONTROL B** button until it lights up (approx. 5 seconds).\
    The button will flash slowly, indicating that Bluetooth is active.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Bluetooth on mobile device">
    The mobile device must have been previously paired with the corresponding BLT200 channel.\
    When Bluetooth is enabled, the connection is automatically reestablished and connected within seconds.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Incoming Calls

<Steps>
  <Step title="Detect the call">
    When a call comes in and Bluetooth is active on the mobile device, the corresponding **CONTROL** button lights up in **blue** (mode D).\
    The call can be answered from the BLT200 with a short press of the CONTROL button, or from the phone screen.

    <Info>
      Some mobile phones prior to 2020 do not allow answering through the Bluetooth interface when calls come from applications (WhatsApp, Skype, Hangouts, etc.).\
      In these cases, calls can only be answered from the phone screen.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="If Bluetooth is off on mobile device">
    Answer the call from the phone itself and then enable Bluetooth to transfer it to the BLT200. Once transferred, the mobile device will send and receive audio through the BLT200.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Private communication">
    Use the console's **talk-back** circuit for private communication with the line (according to the configured connection mode).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Put on air">
    The call will be put on air from the console channel.\
    Adjust the levels of each BLT200 Bluetooth channel from the panel controls to deliver optimal level.
  </Step>
  <Step title="End communication">
    The call can be ended with a short press of the **CONTROL** button, or directly from the phone.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Return call to mobile device">
    The call can be returned to the phone by switching from **Bluetooth/Headset** mode to **Speaker** mode.

    Example in Android:

    <img
      src="/images/android_bluetooth.jpg"
      alt="Android Bluetooth Jp"
      title="Android Bluetooth Jp"
      style={{ width:"25%" }}
    />

    - _Bluetooth_: transfers the call to Bluetooth device (e.g. BLT200).
    - When _Bluetooth_ is disabled, the call returns to the phone.

    Other models may show two buttons, dropdown menus, or other combinations (check phone manual).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Making Calls from Mobile Device

    Make the call (SEND), either by phone or through applications (WhatsApp, Skype, Linphone, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transfer call to BLT200">
    Once communication is established, reactivate **Bluetooth/Headset** mode on the mobile device.\
    The corresponding channel on BLT200 must be turned on.
