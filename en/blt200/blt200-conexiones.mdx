## Power Supply

The unit is powered by an external switching power supply of **12 V / 1.25 A**, provided from factory.

## Inputs and Outputs

The connection panel features two ¼" (6.32 mm) TRS jacks that provide, according to configuration:

- **AUDIO IN**: receives the audio sent to mobile phones, i.e., what the person on the other end of the line hears.
- **AUDIO OUT**: delivers the incoming signal from mobiles, i.e., the voice of the person on the other end of the line.

BLT200 allows configuring the input/output connector signals in different operation modes for integration with broadcast and general sound consoles.\
Configuration is done through six microswitches (dip-switch), whose function is indicated on the panel's silkscreen.

| dip-switch | Function                                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| DSW 1      | Sends channel B through ring on output (TIP: A / RING: B) |
| DSW 2      | Sums channel B to tip on output (TIP: A+B / RING: NC)    |
| DSW 3      | Not connected                                           |
| DSW 4      | Enables conference from B to A                          |
| DSW 5      | Enables conference from A to B                          |
| DSW 6      | Sends AUDIO OUT tip to AUDIO IN ring                    |

## Mode A – Connection to Solidyne Consoles

Solidyne compact consoles DX816/822, D612 and previous series 2300 and 2600 feature a dedicated **External Hybrid** connection, avoiding the use of line channels and auxiliary mix.

| Dip-switch configuration                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| DSW 2 and 6: active <br />DSW 4 and 5: active (conference) <br />DSW 1 and 3: off                                   |

  alt="Blt200 Diagram HIB EXT Pn"
  title="Blt200 Diagram HIB EXT Pn"
  className="mr-auto"
  style={{ width:"50%" }}
/>

**Connection**

- **BLT200 Output**: not connected.
- **BLT200 Input (AUDIO IN)**: becomes input/output. Connected with a standard TRS cable, factory provided.
  - Tip: receives signal from console (adjustable with IN GAIN preset).
  - Ring: sends A+B mix to console.

On the console, BLT200's A+B channel sum enters through the hybrid channel. In conference, if both lines are on-air, the mix is adjusted from BLT200's panel controls.\
Conference against the console's internal hybrid is also supported. The operator can talk privately with the lines in the same way as with the internal hybrid.

## Mode B – Single Channel Connection (all consoles)

| Dip-switch configuration                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DSW 2: active <br />DSW 4 and 5: active (conference) <br />DSW 1, 3 and 6: off                         |
| <img   src="/images/blt200/DSW_Mixed_conferencia.png"   alt="DSW Mode B"   style={{ width:"22%" }} /> |

<img

  alt="Blt200 Diagram Mixed Pn"
  title="Blt200 Diagram Mixed Pn"
  style={{ width:"50%" }}
/>

**Connection**

- **BLT200 Output**: delivers A and B signals mixed on tip. Ring remains disconnected.\
  Connected using the included "Y" breakout cable (TRS to TS), using only the tip plug; or using a simple TRS cable.
- **BLT200 Input**: receives signal on tip, connected to a console output with the included TRS cable.

<Danger>
  Ensure **DSW 6 = OFF**. \
  Otherwise BLT200 output will be connected to console output.
</Danger>

**On Console**\
An auxiliary mix bus (mix-minus) is required to send to BLT200 the signal that the caller will hear.\
Local microphones must be sent, but never CEL-A and CEL-B signals that enter mixed to the console, to avoid feedback.\
In conference, A and B levels are adjusted from BLT200's panel.

The operator can talk privately with the phones by activating PFL on the corresponding channel and using a microphone assigned to the auxiliary mix.

## Mode C – Dual Channel Connection (all consoles)

| Dip-switch configuration                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DSW 1: active <br />DSW 4 and 5: active (conference) <br />DSW 2, 3 and 6: off                                  |
| <img   src="/images/blt200/DSW_Independientes_conferencia.png"   alt="DSW Mode C"   style={{ width:"22%" }} /> |

  alt="Blt200 Diagram Independent Pn"
  title="Blt200 Diagram Independent Pn"
  style={{ width:"46%" }}
/>

**Connection**

- **BLT200 Output**: delivers A and B signals separately (tip = A, ring = B).\
  Connected to two console inputs using the provided "Y" cable (TRS to 2 × TS).
- **BLT200 Input**: receives signal on tip, connected to console's auxiliary output using the provided TRS cable.

<Danger>
  Ensure **DSW 6 = OFF**. \
  Otherwise BLT200 output will be connected to console output.
</Danger>

**On Console**\
An auxiliary bus (mix-minus) is required. Local microphones are sent to the mix, but not BLT200's A and B signals.\
The operator can talk privately with each mobile by activating PFL on the corresponding channel.

---

## Mode D – Dual BLT200 (4 mobiles)

  alt="Blt200 Diagram Double Pn"
  title="Blt200 Diagram Double Pn"
  style={{ width:"52%" }}
/>

This configuration uses two BLT200 units connected to two console channels, allowing handling up to four mobiles.

Each BLT200 is configured in **Mode B** (A+B summed).

- **BLT200 Outputs**: connected to two console inputs using TRS cables.
- **BLT200 Inputs**: connected to a console auxiliary output using a TRS to two TS "Y" breakout cable (provided).

<Danger>
  Ensure **DSW 6 = OFF**. \
  Otherwise BLT200 output will be short-circuited and there will be no audio.
</Danger>

## Conferences

Conference activates internal cross-return, allowing phones to hear each other when two lines are simultaneously on-air.

| DSW 4 and 5 ON: conference enabled. <br /><br />DSW 4 and 5 OFF: no conference (mobiles can be on-air simultaneously but won't hear each other). |
