## Introduction

There is much talk about **Podcasts**, although their meaning is not always clear.\
The term **POD** refers generically to a portable audio player (iPod, mobile phone or MP3 player), while **BROADCAST** means the distribution of audio/video content in program format to a wide audience.

Therefore, **PODCAST** is the on-demand distribution of programs and content in MP3 format to portable players.

## AudiCast Module

The **AudiCast** control fully automates the three stages required to create a radio program in Podcast format:

1. Records the program in MP3, from the opening promo until the closing audio.
   - A single MP3 file is generated for each program broadcast during the day.
2. Automatically transfers these files to the **Internet publishing server**.
3. Creates a **link on the radio station's website**, so listeners can:
   - Download the program to their portable players.
   - Listen to it directly from the web at their preferred time.

This technological revolution of on-demand content gives control to the listener, who decides when to listen to their favorite program.

With **AUDICOM**, podcast publishing becomes a **simple and automated** task. Additionally, since all station programs are recorded, the production department can:

- Schedule reruns of successful programs.
- Cover host vacations.
- Use these recordings as **legal copies**, safeguarding all content broadcast on air.
