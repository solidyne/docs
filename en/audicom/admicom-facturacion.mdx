In **ADMICOM**, the `Reports > Sales` option allows exporting the complete database for integration with third-party billing systems.

The procedure is straightforward:

1. Select the date range for export.
2. Click **Report**.
3. Click the **Export to Excel** button.

This process should be performed **once a month** to obtain all commercial fields that ADMICOM stores for each advertising order. The resulting file can be imported by any external billing software used by the station.

### Custom management reports

ADMICOM also allows generating **custom report templates** that can be exported to Excel format for use by station management.

These reports enable analysis of data such as:

- Billable amounts per client.
- Sales by program.
- Sales by agency.
- Distribution by business category.
- Monthly totals.

In the `Reports > Sales` module, the upper right panel includes customization tools:

- Users can work with a **3-axis cube (X, Y, Z)** to organize data.
- Once designed, reports can be **saved** for reuse or **loaded** using the `LOAD / SAVE` buttons.
- The **PIVOT** button allows applying filters to generate virtually any type of possible report.

When the data is ready, simply export it using the **Excel** button. The resulting file can be:

- Imported into other programs that read spreadsheets.
- Used directly in Excel to design more detailed charts and management reports.

### Key fields for integration

Among all available report fields, some are **crucial for interrelating ADMICOM with the external billing system**:

- **Agency Number:**\
  Campaign code assigned by agencies.\
  Usually follows the format `1234/0`, where the digit after the slash indicates revisions (e.g., `1234/1` after a _Cancel and Replace_ process).
- **Internal Number:**\
  Code assigned by ADMICOM to each new loaded order.\
  This number is **unique** and also follows the `1234/0` convention.\
  When using the _Cancel and Replace_ function, the original schedule is kept with an expired date, and a new version is generated with incremental numbering (`1234/1`, `1234/2`, etc.).\
  This field is the most suitable for uniquely identifying orders in an external billing system.
- **Client:**\
  Name of the client to be billed.
- **Gross:**\
  Total amount to be billed.\
  (The report also includes partial amounts and intermediate discounts that may be useful for certain management systems).
