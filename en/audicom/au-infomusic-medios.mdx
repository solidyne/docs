AUDICOM works with a system folder architecture, located within a main **AUDICOM** folder on each disk drive.\
The media folder is **AUDIO** (although in _BLACK VIDEO_ versions it can also contain video).\
Inside **AUDIO**, folders are created that will be shown as **CATEGORIES** in **AUDICOM Media Manager** and **InfoMusic**.

Structure example:

```
C:\Audicom\Audio (AUDICOM media folder)
HIP-HOP
POP 80's
POP 90's
ROCK ENG
ROCK SPA
SPOTS
JINGLES
```

Folders located outside the **AUDICOM** media folder are ignored by the system (they don't appear in Media Manager).\
Additionally, subfolders within media folders are not allowed: if they exist, AUDICOM ignores them.

It's possible to create or move folders from Windows Explorer, although it's recommended to do it from **Media Manager**.

**`Procedure to import folders into the Audicom\Audio structure:`**

- Use **AUDICOM Media Manager** to create new folders. Enable the **autoDb** option so that when copying files, Media Manager automatically adds them to the Database.
- From Windows Explorer, open the folder containing the files you want to copy and drag them to a **Media Manager** window.
  - If the files are on the same disk drive, they will be **moved**.
  - To copy them, hold down the **Ctrl** key while dragging.

<Note>
  The reverse procedure (dragging files from Media Manager to Windows folders) is **not supported**.
</Note>

For music files to be used in automatic programming (**AutoDj**), they must be registered in the **InfoMusic Database**.

## General Recommendations

### Audio Compression Rates

With current storage capacities readily available, the use of MP3 and other lossy codecs has become limited to **transmission or personal consumption** purposes.\
It is not necessary for a radio station to work with compressed material, except for some cases (syndicated programs or streaming).

It is recommended that all music, jingles, commercials and other audio material be stored in **PCM (WAV)** to maintain maximum quality.

AUDICOM also supports lossless **FLAC compression**, with compression rates close to **2:1**, suitable for long-duration content that requires quality preservation.

<Note>
  Do not use music files with bitrates lower than **128 kbps**.\
  The recommended speed is **256 kbps @ 44.1 kHz**, which equals approximately **6:1** compression.
</Note>

### Editing Compressed Files

Although compressed files can be edited, this process involves **re-compression**, resulting in additional quality loss.

If possible, avoid editing compressed material.\
To remove silence at the beginning and end of `.mp3` files, use **AutoEdit**, which allows processing without re-compression.

### Voice-overs and "Sweepers"

Presentation files (**Partner**) and **Meteor** voice-overs (when re-recorded) should be recorded using a **microphone processor with compressor/limiter**, to reduce dynamic range and ensure **intelligibility** without excessively attenuating background music.

Software dynamic range compressors can also be used, in addition to the station's general audio processing.
