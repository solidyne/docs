## General Concepts

**BotNews** is a powerful on-air news report manager and generator, designed for stations with a high level of **automation**.

- Works **autonomously**, without operator intervention.\
  Interrupts programming to broadcast a news block and then resumes transmission adjusting timing.
- Supports playback of **remotely sent audio files**.
- Uses **text-to-speech (TTS)** and **AI-generated** voices to read remotely sent texts.
- Generates its own reports based on **predefined topics** through **web syndication (RSS)**, which are read on-air by virtual voices.

During automated programming (AutoDJ), BotNews monitors for incoming **remote news**.\
When a news item arrives, it is **immediately** scheduled for broadcast, with opener, separators and closer.

News files can be received from **synchronized FTP folders** or email attachments through **AUDICOM WebTools** functions.

To avoid interrupting commercial breaks, BotNews evaluates the **remaining time of the current title**:

- Only inserts the news if there are **more than 25 seconds** left to finish.

Additionally, there is a **confirmation time** before validating a file as suitable:

- Default: **30 seconds** (configurable).
- This allows a journalist to modify or replace a file, for example, in telephone recordings or FTP transfers.

<Note>
  BotNews was **not** designed to be used while the **On-Air Screen** is in a **LIVE** block.

## Screen and Configuration

The module is manually launched from the **"+"** menu in the toolbar.\
When started, the following window appears:

<img
  src="/images/audicom/au-BotNews.png"
  alt="Au Bot News Pn"
  title="Au Bot News Pn"
  style={{ width:"65%" }}
/>

- **News source directory**:\
  Up to **4 system folders** can be defined as news sources.
  - If not needed, leave fields empty.
  - Recommended to keep them within the **AUDICOM** folder.
  - Can be local or network folders (`UNC`).

  Broadcasted files are moved to the `\Audicom\Audio\OldNews` folder, renamed as:

DayOfWeek_Hour_Minute.wav

This prevents them from being rebroadcast.

<Note>
  If the source folder is on a network drive, **write permission** is required. Otherwise, the news will loop and be scheduled indefinitely.
</Note>

- **Opening**: File played before the report.\
  Must be in the **source folder** and included with full name and extension.\
  If left empty, it won't play even if it exists.
- **News**: Allows defining a **filter** to select news files.\
  Example:

urgent\*.mp3

Only files whose name begins with "urgent" will be scheduled.

- **Announcer**: Defines the **system voice** that will read the texts.
- The field on the right adjusts the **attenuation in dB** for background music.
- **Back music**: Audio loop used as **background** for read news.
- **Closing**: File played after the news (same logic as Opening).
- **Safe Time**:\
  Wait time (in minutes) before validating a newly generated news item.
- Useful when a journalist needs to **review, confirm or re-record** a story.

## Main Controls

- **Start**: Activates BotNews in the background.
- When it detects and validates a news item, it inserts a **PAUSE** in CyberPlay after the currently playing title.
- When that title ends, BotNews emerges in the On-Air Screen and plays the news block.
- Once finished, AUDICOM resumes programming adjusting timing.

Broadcasted files are moved to `\Audicom\Audio\OldNews` and are also recorded in the **broadcast logs**.

- **Play**:\
  Allows during configuration to **preview** TTS voices and adjust background music level.
- **Stop**:\
  Interrupts current audio playback or TTS reading.

<Note>
  The BotNews module supports **Autorun** mode.\
  If this is enabled in AUDICOM (General Configuration Panel), BotNews will automatically activate if, after launching it, no operation is performed within one minute.
