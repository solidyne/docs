## I-Logon

The installer creates an AUDICOM shortcut on the Windows desktop and an applications group in the **Start** menu.

When running AUDICOM, the system login window (**Log-on**) appears.

  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"66%" }}
/>

- Here you must enter username and password.
- The corresponding profile will load, including desktop organization and default security levels.
- Users with permissions and restrictions are managed from the **Administration Panel** (see _Access levels and passwords_).

It is recommended that each operator logs out at the end of their shift.\
The system will continue running under the system user (**auto**).\
The new operator must log in by accessing the I-Logon window with a double click on the **RADIO/USER** area.

- Double clicking the **USER** icon opens the I-Logon window.

  />

<Note>
  I-Logon and the Tool Bar (Info button) show the expiration date of the support and updates license.
</Note>

After entering username and password, press **Start**.

- The username is **not case-sensitive**.
- The password **is case-sensitive**.

All user changes are logged in the `.air` files, so management staff can track who operated the system at any time.

## Usernames and passwords

### Predefined users

AUDICOM includes a set of default users with different profiles:

- **user**
- **admin**
- **auto**

Predefined users have no password.\
The **auto** user is part of the system and **cannot be deleted**.

- It activates when an operator logs out.
- Maintains programming in automatic mode.

<Note>
  Auto mode is also used after a power failure.\
  If the I-Logon window remains open for 1 minute without any user logging in, AUDICOM starts automatically.\
  Audio playback begins one minute later.\
  See: _Power failures - auto-start_.
</Note>

### New users

- Usernames and passwords are defined by the administrator.
- Once created, the username cannot be modified.
- The password can be changed from I-Logon:
  1. Press **Change Password**.
  2. Enter current password.
  3. Type new password and confirm it.
  4. Click **OK**.

The new password will be required at next login.

<Tip>
  You can create a user per operator, or users per workstation (e.g. "Production", "Programming").\
  This way each terminal has a single access key.
</Tip>

## Logging out

When an operator leaves, they must **log out** to prevent unauthorized use.

- If another operator logs in, they do so directly with their user.
- This automatically closes the previous session.

If you want to leave the system active without an operator in charge:

- Select **Log out** in I-Logon.
- AUDICOM will remain active under the **auto** user.

In this mode:

- Only basic functions are enabled (**Play / Stop**).
- Desktop customizations are not saved.
- Changes to commercial schedule are not allowed.

<Warning>
  Programming must be prepared for AUDICOM to continue operating automatically (AutoDJ, streaming, PlayLists, etc.).
</Warning>

## Shutting down AUDICOM

To close all applications, press **Close**.\
This will terminate all AUDICOM-related programs.
