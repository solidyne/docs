Creating a **music programming template (format)** for AutoDJ defines the criteria by which the system will automatically select and play music. A format establishes rules like **styles**, **artists**, **composers**, **genres**, **tempos/modes**, and includes options for **promos** and **voice tracks**.

---

## Steps to create a format

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select target terminal">
    In networks with multiple **On-Air terminals**, choose the terminal where the format will be used from the terminals menu.\
    If there is only one terminal, the format will automatically be created in the correct location.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new format">
    Press **`NEW`** to start with a blank configuration.\
    Enter the **format name** in the **`Format`** field.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define musical styles">
    In **`Styles`**, expand the list of **styles** from the **Database** and press **`Add`** to include them.

    - To include **all styles**, check **`All`**.
    - To **remove** a style, select it and press **`Delete`**.

    **Induced Mode:** defines **how many titles** per style will be scheduled.\
    Each time you press **`Add`**, the style is added to the end of the sequence.\
    Example: _Pop, Pop, Pop, Classic80s, Latin_ → AutoDJ will schedule **3 Pop**, **1 Classic80s** and **1 Latin**, then restart the cycle.\
    You can **reorder** using drag & drop.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose artists (optional)">
    Add allowed artists for this format.\
    The **`Repeat every`** box defines the **minimum number** of songs between two by the **same artist** (indicative value, not strict).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose composers (optional)">
    Add allowed composers.\
    The logic is the same as for **artists**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Include Top Hits (optional)">
    Enable **Top Hits** to periodically schedule titles marked as **Top** in **InfoMusic-Production**.\
    Select the category (e.g., **Top-10**, **Top-40**) and **frequency**.\
    Example: _Top-10 every 0.5 h_ → a **Top-10** song approximately **every 30 minutes**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define genres and their repetitions">
    For each **genre**, assign a value in **`Repeat`** indicating how many **titles of different genres** must be played **at minimum** between two of the same genre.\
    Example: if _Male Solo_ = **3**, between two songs of that genre there will be **at least 3** of different genres. (Not a strict rule.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Tempo and Mode matrices">
    Mark the **combinations to restrict** in the **Tempo** (speed) and **Mode** (sound character) matrices.

    - **Marked boxes** → reduce the probability of that combination occurring.
    - **No restrictions** → leave **all cells blank**.

    Example: if in the **"Soft" row** you mark the **"Very Strong" column**, AutoDJ will avoid playing a **very strong** song after a **soft** one.

    **Prediction rule (first song of block):** if a **complete row** is marked (e.g., _Allegro_), that value loses priority as **first song** of the block, to avoid leaving no compatible successors.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Insert promotional spots (Promos)">
    In **`Promos`**, the **`Every Titles`** field defines after how many **musical tracks** a **promo** will be inserted.\
    The **`Promo`** field allows filtering by **prefix** of the promo **title** (e.g.: "Summer" → only _PromoPGM_ whose title begins with "Summer").

    **Recommended categories in InfoMusic:**

    - **`PromoPGM`**: program-specific promos; inserted every _n_ songs by AutoDJ.
    - **`Promo`**: general 24/7 promos; useful for **time adjustments** (exact pre-break).
    - **`Separators`**: pieces that should **not** be handled automatically.

    <Note>
      In `Autodj.ini` you can redefine which category AutoDJ uses when inserting every _n_ songs: `promoPgmClass=PromoPgm` (default) or `Promo`.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable voice tracks (Partners)">
    Enable **`Use Partner Files`** to play **voice tracks** associated with each song (Partner files).\
    If disabled, voice tracks won't play even if they exist.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the format (CHECK)">
    Press **`CHECK`** to validate the format and detect **errors** (e.g., styles not in the Database). If a style was deleted, AutoDJ might **replace** it with **promos** to meet timing; it's better to correct the format.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the format">
    Press **`Save`** (disk icon).\
    The format will be available in the **formats menu**.\
    To modify it later: select it, edit and **save** again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Important considerations

- A **template** primarily determines which **styles** AutoDJ can use.
- **Styles** come from the **Database** (not dependent on folder structure).
- If no format is assigned, **`Default`** will be used, which includes **all** available styles.
- In multi-terminal installations, create/edit formats by selecting the **Current Terminal** (see _AUDICOM networking_).

<Note>
  The **Default** format acts as a fallback when no specific format is assigned.
