## Overview

This module allows you to **quickly record audio files**. Once recorded, files can be edited to:

- remove silence,
- delete sections,
- duplicate segments,
- concatenate files and save them as one.

When the file is ready, it can be added to the **Database** through **InfoMusic**.

HD Corder is divided into two sections: **Recording** and **Editing**, described below.

When pressed, opens dialog to configure:

- **Title**: up to 32 characters.

<Note>
  Following characters not allowed in filenames: `/ * \ " | ? < > :`\
  Files with periods (`.`) in name not recognized, example: `99.5.wav`.\
  `995.wav` is valid and can be registered in InfoMusic as **99.5**.
</Note>

If VU meters show no signal while recording, check **Windows Mixer** to ensure **line input** is selected.

### AutoStart

Starts recording automatically when input signal detected.

- Behavior adjusted in `Audicom.ini` under `[AutoRecord]`:
  - `StartLevel`: minimum level to start.
  - `StartHoldTime`: time level must maintain.
  - `StartRecordTime`: audio stored in buffer and inserted at start to prevent cuts.

### AutoStop

Stops recording automatically when signal disappears.

- Configure in `Audicom.ini` → `[AutoRecord]`:
  - `StopLevel`: minimum level to stop.
  - `StopHoldTime`: time level must maintain.
  - `StopRecordTime`: trim applied at end to reduce silence.

Factory-set for tracks with **fade out** or sustained endings.

- Abrupt endings may leave 1-2s silence.
- Manually adjust parameters if needed, considering long fades could be truncated.

### InfoMusic

Launches InfoMusic to register recorded title in Database.
