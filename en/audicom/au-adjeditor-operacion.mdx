## Scan — Batch File Registration / Database Check

The **Scan** tool searches all files in a folder and reports those **not** registered in the Database, allowing batch or individual registration.

**Procedure:**

1. Click **Scan** and select the folder to explore.
   - On networks, browse via UNC paths so file references are like `\\Server\Share\Path`.
2. After clicking **Open**, a window displays the **list of unregistered files**.
   - Select one or multiple files: drag with left mouse button or use **Ctrl + click** for multiple selection.
3. Use the window controls:
   - **Clear**: empties the list.
   - **Scan**: performs a **new scan** and **adds** results to current list.
   - **Close**: closes Scan window. Clicking **Scan** again shows the **last list** kept in memory (until InfoMusic-Prod is closed).
   - **Add**: starts the **registration** of selected files.

**Registration with Add (two modes):**

- **Single file**:\
  Copies its name to **File Name** and **Title** fields (equivalent to loading with **New**). Complete remaining fields and click **Save** to register.\
  For **MP3** files, it attempts to read **ID3** fields to pre-fill metadata (if available).
- **Multiple files**:\
  Clicking **Add** shows a **common parameters form** (applied to _all_ selected files) to speed up batch registration:
  - **Class**: file type (`Music`, `Promos`, `Spots`, `Fills`, etc.).
  - **Style**: `Rock`, `Pop`, `Jazz`, `Classical`, `Electronic`, etc. (define and maintain consistent taxonomy).
  - **Artist**: useful when all files belong to same artist.
  - **Fade In / Out**: initial and final fade times. InfoMusic suggests **2.5 s** by default.
  - **Interpret Filename as**: automatic mapping of `Artist` and `Title` from filename.\
    E.g.: for files like `Depeche Mode - I Feel You.mp3`, select pattern **`<Artist>-<Title>`**:
    - `Artist` = `Depeche Mode`
    - `Title` = `I Feel You`

  After confirming with **OK**, titles are added **directly** to Database. Upon completion, a **summary** appears (some files may not be registered if a matching **Title** exists or if file is **invalid**).

<Note>
  Before using batch registration, **normalize** filenames to `Artist - Title` pattern (with spaces) to improve mapping results and maintain order in **backups**.

## Record Search (Search) `[F5]`

InfoMusic allows simple and combined searches across multiple fields.

### Title Search (basic mode)

- Type in **TITLE** and click **AtoZ**.
- With **EXHAUSTIVE enabled**: returns all titles **containing** the word in **any position**.
- With **EXHAUSTIVE disabled**: returns only titles that **begin** with the word.
- A **single letter** returns all titles starting with that letter.

### Combined Parameter Search

- Fill one or more fields (Author, Style, Class, Label, etc.) and click **Start search** (or **F5**).
- Fields you **don't** want to filter should remain **empty**.
- Examples:
  - `Author = Mozart` → list of **all** Mozart pieces.\
    Adding `Label = EMI` → shows **only** EMI releases.\
    Adding `Style = Opera` → Mozart **Opera** released by **EMI**.
  - `Class = Promos` → all registered **Promos**.
  - Specific title: for `Mi Buenos Aires Querido`, search by `Querido` (exhaustive) or by `M` + `Artist = Carlos Gardel` to narrow to Gardel titles starting with `M`.

### "Found Records" Window

Shows search **results** in **alphabetical order**, with **duration** and **path** of associated file. Colors follow **File Manager** convention (time since last play):

- **Red**: `< 4 hours`
- **Orange**: `4 to 12 hours`
- **Green**: `12 to 24 hours`
- **Black**: `> 24 hours`

## Context Menu (right click)

Available options on any title in results:

- **Play / Stop**: plays the file.
- **FileManager**: opens **File Manager** module.
- **Delete**: removes the **record** from Database.
- **Sort by name**: sorts alphabetically.
- **Sort by length**: sorts by **duration** (ascending).

## Navigation Buttons `[↑ / ↓]`

Allow moving **one by one** through items in **Selected Records** (or "Found Records"), navigating the list with cursor **arrows**.

## Save Record (Save) `[F2]`

**Saves** the title with all parameters to Database.

- With individual entry (via **New**), remember to **Save** to register.
- With **batch** registration (via **Scan + Add**), titles are **directly registered** (no Save needed).
- **Any modification** to metadata requires **Save** to persist.

## Delete Record

Removes a **title** from Database:

- If **Delete file** is **NOT** checked, only the **record** is removed (audio remains on disk).
- If **Delete file** is checked, both **record** and **audio file** are removed (confirmation required).\
  Action is **irreversible**.

**Remember:** Files **not** in Database **cannot** be used by **AutoDJ**; therefore, they won't be considered when automating music blocks.

## Clear Fields

- **Clear all** `[F6]`: clears **all** form fields for new search/entry.
- **Clear except Artist** `[F7]`: clears all fields **except** `Artist` (useful for artist searches).

## Print

Available options (through **Windows default printer**):

- **Print record data**: prints **all parameters** of currently selected title.
- **Queried titles with location**: prints **complete list** shown in "Found Records", with **duration** and **path**.
- **Queried titles with artist**: prints **complete list** shown, including **Artist** for each record.

## Exit

Minimizes **InfoMusic-Prod** screen.\
To restore, click **InfoMusic** button in **AUDICOM Applications Bar**.

## Transfer — File Transfer Between Terminals

When **Production** operator adds new titles, they must be **exported** to other network terminals to be available in their local Databases.\
This procedure is common in **large networks** with multiple On-Air terminals.\
Clicking **Transfer** button accesses advanced title transfer functions.

### What to copy?

First step is determining **which records** will be exported. Four options:

- **Current on-screen title**\
  Exports **only** currently selected title.
- **Search results**\
  Exports all titles from a query result.\
  Example: after searching by **Style** or **Artist**, you can transfer all those titles together.
- **Titles entered in last N days**\
  Exports **all** titles loaded in recent days.\
  Right field allows entering number of days.\
  Example: `3` = exports all titles entered in last **three days**.
- **Entire Database**\
  Exports **complete Database**, allowing full data duplication.\
  (See **Style Filter** section for details).

### Where to copy?

Second step defines **destination terminals**.\
System shows terminal list with AUDICOM installation location (example: `\\ONAIR\C`).

Available options:

- **Single terminal**\
  Exports titles to **one terminal**, selected from dropdown menu.
- **All terminals**\
  Transfers titles to **all network terminals** operating with Database.
- **Multiple specific terminals**\
  Allows specifying multiple destination terminals using **UNC** paths separated by semicolon `;`.\
  Example:\
  `\\FM\C\Audicom\Db; \\AM\C\Audicom\Db`

  In this case, titles export to **FM** and **AM** terminals.

### Style Filter

**Style Filter** defines how to handle **Music Styles** during export:

- **Yes, styles must exist in destination terminal**\
  Titles **won't transfer** if style doesn't exist in destination terminal.\
  Example:
  - FM-1 → Rock & Pop, youth-oriented with current Hits.
  - FM-2 → 80's Classics and Melodic, adult-oriented.\
    Production loads titles for both stations.\
    When exporting, each terminal accepts only titles with **compatible styles** for its profile.\
    If style doesn't exist in FM-2, it won't transfer.
- **No, copy without validation**\
  All selected titles transfer.\
  If style doesn't exist in destination terminal, it's **automatically created** there.

### Include Audio

Final step decides whether to copy **audio files** too, or just **Database records**.

### Recommendations

- For **jingles or promos**: best to duplicate on each On-Air terminal, ensuring independence and reliability.
- For **music**: network-dependent. Generally, files reside on On-Air terminals or shared Server.
- See: **"AUDICOM Network → Audio Files"**.

### Options

- **Yes, copy audio to equivalent location**\
  Files copy to same folders in destination terminals.\
  Example: if files are in `Tango` folder in Production, system looks for `Tango` folder within `audioDrives` units at destination.
  - If not found, creates it on destination terminal's `C` drive.
- **Don't copy audio**\
  Only transfers Database **references**.\
  Files remain at original location (Production or entry terminal).

<Note>
  If destination terminal's `C` drive lacks space, audio copy operation **fails**.\
  In that case: transfer only **records** then copy files with **File Manager**.\
  When file plays on-air, AUDICOM **automatically corrects** Database location.

  Units must be declared in **UNC format**.\
  Example: if `audicom.ini` shows `AudioDrives=CD`, InfoMusic-Prod interprets as:\
  `\\terminal_name\C; \\terminal_name\D`.
