### Usage

- As the **On-Air program** plays titles, it notifies the RDS module.
- The module accesses the database to obtain the required information.

Available features:

- **Real-time messages**: type the text in the _Flash Msg_ field and press **[Flash]**.
- **Traffic announcement**:
  - Enable the _Send as traffic announce_ checkbox.
  - Some RDS receivers display the main information and traffic announcement simultaneously; others alternate between both.
- **Differentiated configuration**: it's possible to define different information for music, commercial blocks or other blocks.
- **Export info to**:
  - Dumps the information generated by RDS to a user-defined text file.
  - Used for RDS hardware not directly supported by AUDICOM.
  - If the hardware application supports reading from an external file, this option enables linking.
  - The location supports **UNC** format.
