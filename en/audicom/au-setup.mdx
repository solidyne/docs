## Installation

### Computer and Sound Card Configuration

#### General Configuration: Recommendations

For proper **AUDICOM** operation, verify that computer and Windows configurations meet the following requirements:

1. **Operating System**: Windows 10/11
2. **Antivirus**: Configure it to exclude `C:/Audicom` and `C:/Admicom` folders on all network terminals. Ensure exceptions are 100% respected.
3. It is recommended to **disable APM (Advanced Power Management)** from the computer's BIOS. After doing so, Windows may request reinstallation of some components.
4. If the computer has integrated sound card, it can be used as monitoring channel (CUE).\\

    <Danger>
      Do not use onboard audio for program output. These cards do not meet minimum quality requirements for professional systems with AUDICOM.
    </Danger>
5. **Screensavers** are not recommended. Instead, configure automatic monitor shutdown when AUDICOM works in automatic mode.
6. **Do not enable scheduled maintenance tasks** in Windows.
7. Set font size to **100%**. Using 125% or 150% may affect AUDICOM window display.
8. Disable **Windows sounds**, as they could accidentally go on air.
9. Configure the **Taskbar** to auto-hide, optimizing screen space for AUDICOM.
10. Avoid keyboards with power off or "sleep" keys. If operators press them by mistake, they could shut down the on-air machine.
    - Disable these functions from Advanced Power Management (APM) in BIOS.
    - The procedure varies by computer model and operating system, and in some cases cannot be disabled.

#### Supported Sound Cards

- Many current broadcast consoles include channels with **USB** connection, eliminating the need for additional audio cards.
- AUDICOM works with interfaces that support **WASAPI, DirectSound or MME** drivers.
- For multichannel interfaces, ensure the hardware is compatible with **WDM or WASAPI**.

  <Note>
    ASIO is not supported by AUDICOM.
  </Note>

Depending on manufacturer, some multichannel interfaces only work in ASIO mode for multichannel audio, but in Windows mode can operate as a single stereo input/output device.

- **Onboard cards**: Can be used as playback channel for monitoring (CUE). Not recommended for on-air output.
- **AoIP Systems**: AUDICOM supports virtualized devices in Audio over IP systems like **Dante** and **LiveWire**.

### License Key

- AUDICOM requires a **USB license key** to operate.
- For security, it is recommended to secure it to the chassis with a seal or cable, or place it inside the case.
- The key enables different modules according to system configuration.

## Full Installation

The **Full** mode installer installs all AUDICOM modules and accessories.\
Recommended for first installation when no previous installations exist.

Includes:

- **Security**: Drivers for license key.
- **AUDICOM**: all main modules (Air, Media Manager, File Manager, InfoMusic Production, CyberPlay Editor, AutoDJ Editor, Internet tools —requires annual subscription—, help files, among others).
- **Admicom**: automatic commercial break generation and billing (Multicast and HD versions).
- **Media**: demo content (music, video clips, effects, promos) —optional—.
- **Programming**: demos —optional—.
- **AutoRec 202**: 24h MP3 recording. Sold separately but enabled for 2 channels through AUDICOM license.
- **Reaper**: audio editor (third-party software developed by Cocko's).

After installation completes:

- System **restart** will be requested.
- An AUDICOM program group will be created in Windows **Start** menu.
- All files will be installed in `C:\AUDICOM` folder, shared with full access for current user.

**Folder structure:**

- `AIR`: on-air broadcast logs.
- `AUDIO`: audio folders used by AUDICOM.\\

  <Warning>
    All audio files must be organized within this folder.
  </Warning>
- `DB`: music database.
- `LA-ICONS`: icons for Live Assist module.
- `LOG`: commercial programming logs.
- `PGM`: music programming logs.
- `METEOR`: time and weather data files.
- `TEXT`: system text files.

<Note>
  This structure is fixed. Its location is defined in the `Audicom.ini` file, which must be modified when installing AUDICOM in network.\
  See: **Audicom Network \> Software Configuration**.
</Note>

#### AStart (Web Tools Services Configuration)

During installation, user and terminal data must be completed. It is essential to carefully register this information and keep it.

- A **multimedia** groups several stations, each with their WebTools users.
  - Example: "National Radio" may contain "AM National", "National Rock", "National Folk".
- The **multimedia name** will be required to access the WebTools Administration Panel, where users are created for each station.
- For standalone stations, the alias (with **-admin** suffix) will be the default administration name.
- This data is confirmed via email sent by the **AUDICOM WebTools** server, validating account creation.

## Migration from Other Systems

### Supported Audio Files

- **PCM**: Uncompressed `.wav` files, 16/24 bits at 44.1/48 kHz.
- **MP3**: 64 – 320 kbps at 44.1 kHz.
- **FLAC**: supported.

**Legacy and obsolete formats:**

- `.wav` encoded in MPEG Layer 3: used in old systems, now obsolete.
- **ADPCM** (typically `.wav` extension): different variants existed; some still supported by Windows. AUDICOM supports **MS-ADPCM** and any **ACM**-compatible variant if corresponding codec is available.
- **MP2 / WAV-MP2 (MPEG Layer 2)**: `.mp2` or `.wav` extension. Used by systems with ANTEX, Digigram or other cards. Can be used directly without conversion if appropriate codec is installed (not included with AUDICOM).
- **Dolby AC2**: `.wav` or `.atx` extensions.\\

  <Danger>
    Not supported by AUDICOM.
  </Danger>

### Audio and Video File Location

AUDICOM works with a rigid folder structure to ensure information maintenance and organization.

All audio and video files must be organized in system subfolders:

```
\AUDICOM\AUDIO
POP 80s
POP 90s
SALSA
ROCK-NEWS
SFX
PROMOS
SPOTS
```

- These folders are called **media folders**.

<Warning>
  They must not contain subfolders; if they exist, AUDICOM ignores them.
</Warning>

If files from previous system are compatible, simply organizing them in these folders allows immediate on-air use.

To create folders and copy media to the system, use **File Manager** or **Media Manager** modules, which ensure correct structure.\
User only selects disk and folder name.\
See **Audicom Media Manager** and **Audicom File Manager** chapters for more information.

### Database

For automated operation (AutoDJ), media files must be entered into the **Media Database**.

- This is done from **Media Manager** (recommended) or **File Manager**.
- The **InfoMusic Production** module allows database management.

See **InfoMusic** chapter for more details.

### Programming Schedule

AUDICOM offers several options for generating commercial and content schedules:

- The **Admicom** module manages commercial schedule through its own database, independent from media database.
- Content programming generation is done from **CyberPlay Editor** and **Admicom**.
