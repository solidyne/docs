This section allows configuring all elements related to the station's business management: **client categories**, **advertising agencies**, **business sectors**, **payment methods**, among others.

## Client Category

Categories allow classifying different types of clients, such as:

- Station promotionals
- Public service campaigns
- Local clients
- National clients

Each category has a **broadcast priority**, represented by a letter from A to Z. This priority defines the order in which ads will be placed within commercial breaks. Categories with the same letter are not allowed.

<Note>
  If a client needs to broadcast ads with different priorities, they should be registered as an **Advertising Agency** instead of a Client.
</Note>

- **Priority**: Letter from A to Z. It is recommended to leave the first letters free for future clients.
- **Code**: Abbreviation of up to 10 alphanumeric characters.
- **Name**: Full name of the category (e.g., _Radio promos_).

## Advertising Agency

Allows registering agencies that group multiple clients. Each agency can concentrate multiple campaigns and handle specific priorities for associated clients.

## Business Sector

Business sectors allow classifying ads according to their theme. Typical examples:

- Restaurants
- Telephony
- Hotels
- Ice cream shops

For each sector, you must define:

- **Code**: Identification of up to 10 alphanumeric characters.
- **Name**: Name of the sector.

<Note>
  The sector definition is linked to the "Allow mixing sectors" option in commercial breaks.\
  In special cases —for example, station promotional breaks— you can activate the option **"Disable rejection of campaigns with same Sector"**, which allows multiple ads from the same sector to coexist in the same break.
</Note>

## Media Central

Groups several **Advertising Agencies** under a parent entity or _holding_. Allows joint monitoring of associated agencies.

## Account Executive

Allows registering **salespeople or account executives**.\
During campaign programming, it is possible to assign an executive to each commercial operation to generate performance reports.

## Payment Method

Defines payment methods accepted by the station: wire transfer, cash, card, barter, etc.\
Each operation can record the method used to facilitate administrative tracking.

## Origin

The "Origin" field allows grouping campaigns according to their source or contractual condition. Some typical examples:

- Barter
- Government advertising
- Public service campaigns
- Own salespeople

<Note>
  These tags are useful for generating specific reports or applying filters within the system.
