There are two ways to create a **commercial break**:

- **Automatic**: using the **Admicom** module (recommended).\
  → See: _Traffic, Administration and Statistics_.
- **Manual**: directly in **CyberPlay Editor**.

Non-commercial radio stations or those with few advertisers typically manage breaks manually, without needing to maintain a commercial database.

## Manual Creation of Breaks

1. In the **Break** window, enter the break instruction.\
   Each instruction corresponds to a single break; you must repeat it for all breaks of the day.

   **Example:**

   ```txt
   /Tanda Break No. 1 /00:00
   ```
2. Below, write the filenames of the advertisements that make up that break.\
   You can drag them from **File Manager** or **InfoMusic-Production**.

   **Example:**

   ```txt
   /Tanda Break No. 1 /00:00
   Coca-Cola
   Sancor
   Sony
   La Masa Records
   ```

   <Note>
     - Files cannot be scheduled from **extra folders** (see File Manager).
     - Files containing a **period (.)** in the name and not registered in the Database **must be scheduled with full extension** (e.g.: `107.5.wav`).
   </Note>
3. To add another break (e.g.: at 00:30), repeat the previous steps.
4. Once all breaks are completed, save the file in the corresponding format (see saving section).

## Creating Breaks with Magic Programming

The **Magic Programming** tool simplifies manual break generation. It automatically inserts the instructions, and the operator only needs to load the files below each break.

<img
  src="/images/audicom/au-cpeditor-easylog-1.png"
  alt="Au Cpeditor Easylog 1 Pn"
  title="Au Cpeditor Easylog 1 Pn"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"37%" }}
/>

When choosing **Generate Break Template**, a dialog box appears with these options:

- **Start time**: start time of the first break.
- **End time**: time of the last break.
- **Interval between breaks**: minutes between each break.
- **Flexibility**: margin in minutes to shift the break in AutoDJ programs.\
  _(All breaks created by Magic Programming are flexible; to change their attributes they must be edited manually)._

### Schedule a Commercial

Allows scheduling a **spot in multiple breaks** automatically.\
Define:

- The **time range** (e.g.: from 19:00 to 22:00).

  <img
    src="/images/audicom/au-cpeditor-easylog-3.png"
    alt="Au Cpeditor Easylog 3 Pn"
    title="Au Cpeditor Easylog 3 Pn"
    className="mr-auto"
    style={{ width:"34%" }}
  />
- The **minimum separation** between appearances (e.g.: every 15 minutes).

The advertisement will be inserted in all breaks within the defined range.

### Remove Advertisement Occurrence

Allows **removing all occurrences** of an advertisement within a specified time range.

<Note>
  Remember: For changes to take effect, you must **save the files** and, if it corresponds to **today's or tomorrow's** programming, you must **reload the files in the On-Air terminal**.
</Note>

### Print

Option to print:

- The **breaks log** (`.LOG`).
- The **programs log** (`.PGM`).
- The **complete schedule** (CyberPlay window).

Printing is performed on the currently loaded files.
