## Introduction

**AUDICOM-14 Black Edition** is a suite of tools designed for management and automation of radio stations and audiovisual media.\
Its modular and flexible design allows adaptation to workflows in both small stations and large media operations with multiple studios.

## Models

### Audicom Black

Version designed for traditional radio stations (without video content).

- Integrates the **Admicom** commercial scheduling module, which manages advertising orders, schedule certification and live mention auditing (PNT).
- Enables centralized management of radio networks, linking remote stations via streaming and synchronizing content through the Internet.
- Publishes content on multiple platforms: on-air broadcasting, web streaming, podcasts and streaming links with smart metadata.
- Metadata allows linking remote stations via Internet or VPN, generating differentiated commercial breaks and local IDs.

### Audicom Black Video

Designed for audiovisual media and Internet broadcasting.

- Incorporates **Audicom Video Composer**, a video switcher with integrated graphics generator for studio camera control.
- Supports HD video playback in all modules, combining sources like cameras, Skype, Zoom and graphics.
- The **AutoVJ** module automates camera direction based on microphone signals received from the on-air console, freeing the operator from this task.
- **AV Composer** encodes and generates audio and video streaming, transmitting to servers for distribution on different platforms.
- This technology allows media outlets to expand and compete in the digital environment without requiring major structural changes or costs.

## Integrated Management

Audicom is not just an audio and video playout system, but covers all production and operation levels of a broadcast station.

### On-air Audio and Video Management

**24-hour Chronological View**

- The main on-air screen (**CyberPlay**) organizes daily programming from 00 to 24 hours.
- Integrates commercials, live segments, automated content, news, pre-recorded material, remote links and special events.
- Can also be used in "commercial break" mode to handle only advertising schedules.

**Live Content**

- The operator has 4 auxiliary playlists (**Playlist Manager**).
- Features two quick access button panels (**Live Assist**), a one-touch recorder (**Instant Rec**) and an SQL database search engine.
- Also includes dedicated monitoring channels.
- All modules handle audio and video, except **iRec**, which records audio only.

**Automated Programming**

- **AutoDJ** automates music sessions in real-time using AI.
- **BotNews** generates and reads breaking news on-air using AI-generated voices.
- Remote content (streaming and communications), pre-recorded material and commercial breaks are also integrated.
- The operator can create assisted music blocks at any time and has control over AutoDJ-generated content.

**Automated Camera Direction**

- For stations with video transmission from studios, **Audicom Video Composer** automates camera switching based on console signals.
- Can operate without camera operators or allow manual direction, as in a TV studio.

## Production

### Commercial Management

- The **Admicom** Traffic and Billing module manages the client and agency database, contracts, commercial break distribution and daily schedule generation.
- Allows auditing of aired spots, generating client reports and exporting spreadsheets for external management systems.
- In stations with lower commercial load, scheduling can be managed manually through playlists.

### Comprehensive Content Management

- Daily 24-hour programming is organized in **CyberPlay Editor**, which covers all events: commercial blocks, live mentions, live segments, breaking news or remote content.
- The system operates continuously, even without on-site assistance.

### Automated Music Programming

- **AutoDJ** offers an advanced AI-based music programming system.
- Unlike systems that generate random playlists, it analyzes each song's characteristics to select music in real-time, adjusting to commercial breaks, news or other priority events.
- Allows defining time segments with customized music criteria.
- Music can be presented with pre-recorded announcements inserted at intro, outro or intermediate points of songs.
- In future versions, these announcements can be generated directly with AI voices without requiring pre-recordings.

## Expansions

### Web Tools

Annual subscription service package that extends system capabilities:

- **Live announcer assistance**: web access to a desktop with on-air title information, upcoming events, PNTs, RSS feeds and internal chat between Audicom stations.
- **News and AI voices**: enables use of voice libraries and RSS feeds for **BotNews** to generate and read news segments.
- **Weather data**: automatically updates for audio announcements or video overlays in AV Composer.
- **Remote technical support**: enabled for all Audicom instances.
