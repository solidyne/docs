## Scan Function

**Simultaneous File Registration / Entry Verification**

The **Scan** tool explores all files in a folder and reports those **not** registered in the Database, allowing bulk or individual registration.

**Step by step procedure:**

1. Click **Scan** and select the folder to explore.
   - On networks, navigate via UNC environment so file references are like `\\Server\Resource\Path`.
2. Click **Open**. A window displays **the list of unregistered files**.
   - Select one or multiple: drag with left mouse button or use **Ctrl + click**.
3. Use the window controls:
   - **Clear**: clears the list (leaves window blank).
   - **Scan**: performs a **new scan** and **adds** results to current list.
   - **Close**: closes Scan window. If you click **Scan** again, the **last list** retained in memory appears (until InfoMusic-Prod is closed).
   - **Add**: starts **registration** of selected files.

**Registration with Add (two modes):**

- **Single file**:\
  Copies its name to **File Name** and **Title** (equivalent to loading with **New**). Complete remaining fields and click **Save** to register.\
  For **MP3** files, metadata is read from **ID3** tags (if available).
- **Multiple files**:\
  When clicking **Add**, a **common parameters form** appears (applies to _all_ selected) to streamline bulk registration:
  - **Class**: file type (`Music`, `Promos`, `Spots`, `Fills`, etc.).
  - **Style**: `Rock`, `Pop`, `Jazz`, `Classical`, `Electronic`, etc. (define and maintain consistent taxonomy).
  - **Artist**: useful if all belong to same artist.
  - **Fade In / Out**: initial and final fade times. By default InfoMusic suggests **2.5 s**.
  - **Interpret Filename as**: automatic mapping of `Artist` and `Title` from filename.\
    Ex.: for files like `Depeche Mode - I Feel You.mp3`, select pattern **`<Artist>-<Title>`**:
    - `Artist` = `Depeche Mode`
    - `Title` = `I Feel You`

  When confirming with **OK**, titles are added **directly** to Database. Upon completion, a **summary** appears: some files may not be registered if an identical **Title** exists or if file is **invalid**.

<Note>
  Before using bulk registration, **normalize** filenames to `Artist - Title` pattern (with spaces) to improve mapping and maintain backup organization.
</Note>

## Record Search `[F5]`

InfoMusic provides great flexibility for searching titles. You can perform **simple** (by title) or **combined** (filtering by multiple fields) searches.

### Title Search (basic mode)

- Type in **TITLE** and click **AtoZ**.
- With **EXHAUSTIVE enabled**: returns all titles that **contain** the word in **any position**.
- With **EXHAUSTIVE disabled**: returns only titles that **begin** with the word.
- If you enter **a single letter**, you'll see titles beginning with that letter.

### Combined Parameter Search

- Fill one or more fields (Author, Style, Class, Label, etc.) and click **Start search** (or **F5**).
- Fields you **don't** want to filter should remain **empty**.

**Examples:**

- `Author = Mozart` → list of **all** Mozart pieces.\
  Adding `Label = EMI` → shows **only** those released by EMI.\
  Adding `Style = Opera` → **Mozart's opera** music released by **EMI**.
- `Class = Promos` → all registered **Promos**.
- Specific title: for "Mi Buenos Aires Querido", search by `Querido` (exhaustive) or by `M` + `Artist = Carlos Gardel` to narrow to Gardel titles starting with `M`.

---

## "Found Records" Window

Shows search **results** in **alphabetical order**, with **duration** and **path** of associated file. Colors follow **File Manager** convention (time since last broadcast):

- **Red**: `< 4 hours`
- **Orange**: `4 to 12 hours`
- **Green**: `12 to 24 hours`
- **Black**: `> 24 hours`

---

## Context Menu (right click)

Available options for any title:

- **Play / Stop**: file playback.
- **FileManager**: opens **File Manager** module.
- **Delete**: removes **record** from Database.
- **Sort by name**: alphabetical sort.
- **Sort by length**: sorts by **duration** (ascending).

---

## Navigation Buttons `[↑ / ↓]`

Allow **one by one** navigation through **Selected Records**, moving through the list with cursor **arrows**.

---

## Save Record `[F2]`

**Saves** the title with all parameters to Database.

- With individual entry (via **New**), remember to **Save** to register.
- With **bulk** registration (via **Scan + Add**), titles are **registered directly** (no Save needed).
- **Any modification** to metadata requires **Save** to persist.

---

## Delete Record

Removes a **title** from Database:

- If **Delete file** is **NOT** checked, only the **record** is removed (audio **remains** on disk).
- If **Delete file** is checked, removes both **record** and **audio file** (asks confirmation).\
  Action is **irreversible**.

**Remember:** Files **not** in Database **cannot** be used by **AutoDJ**; therefore, they won't be considered when automating music blocks.

---

## Clear Fields

- **Clear all** `[F6]`: clears **all** form fields.
- **Clear except Artist** `[F7]`: clears all fields **except** `Artist` (useful for artist searches).

---

## Print

Available options (through **Windows default printer**):

- **Print record data**: prints **all parameters** of selected title.
- **Queried titles with location**: prints complete list shown in "Found Records", with **duration** and **path**.
- **Queried titles with artist**: prints complete list shown, including **Artist** for each record.

---

## Exit

Minimizes **InfoMusic-Prod** screen.\
To restore, click **InfoMusic** button in **AUDICOM Applications Bar**.

# Network Databases

In **Network** systems you can operate **one or several** Databases simultaneously (according to Air terminals). AUDICOM can work with **multiple DBs** thanks to **SDB (Synchronized Databases)**.\
In large networks, files are **recorded and registered in Production**, then **sent** to Air terminals.\
For detailed configurations, see **"AUDICOM Network \> Databases"**.

From a production terminal you can **browse** any network DB (very useful with multiple Air terminals).\
Available terminals appear in **"Current terminal"** menu.

- **Default host** points to **local terminal**, unless redefined in `audicom.ini`.
- On **first deployment**, menu **scans network** for active AUDICOM terminals (may take time). Result is **cached**.
- To **update** list, use **`_update hosts...`**.

---

## Transfer — File Transfer Between Different Terminals

When operator adds titles in **Production**, they must then **export** them to other network terminals (typical in networks with multiple AIR).\
Clicking **Transfer** accesses advanced functions to **migrate titles** between different **Databases**.

### What do you want to copy?

Define **which** records to export (four options):

1. **Current title on screen**: exports **only** selected title.
2. **Titles shown in query results**: exports **search results** (useful for moving by Style, Artist, etc.).
3. **Titles entered in last N days**: exports **all** titles added in last **N** days (e.g., `3` = last **3** days).
4. **All Database titles**: exports **complete DB** (allows duplicating all data; see **Style filter**).

### Where do you want to copy to?

Define **destination terminals**. You'll see a list with AUDICOM location (e.g., `\\AIR\C`). Choose:

- **1 terminal**: exports to **one** terminal (selection from right dropdown menu).
- **All terminals**: exports to **all** terminals with operative DB.
- **Specific terminals**: indicate multiple destination terminals with **UNC** separated by **semicolon**:
  - `\\FM\C\Audicom\Db; \\AM\C\Audicom\Db`

### Style Filter

Validates destination terminals' **Styles** when exporting. If Style doesn't exist in destination, can **reject** transfer or **create** Style in destination.

- **Yes, styles must exist in destination**:\
  Titles whose Style **doesn't** exist in destination terminal aren't transferred.\
  _Example_: Two FMs with different profiles. If you export "last 5 days" to **FM-1** (Rock & Pop) and **FM-2** (80's Classics and Melodic), each terminal **will only accept titles** whose Styles exist in its own DB.
- **No, copy without validating Style existence in destination**:\
  **All** titles are transferred; if Style is missing, it's **created** in destination.

### Include Audio

Decide whether to **copy audio files** or transfer **only** Database **records**:

- **Yes, copy audio to equivalent location**:\
  Copies audio to destination terminals using **same folders** as Production.\
  If Production file is in `\Audicom\Audio\Tango`, system looks for `Tango` among destination **audioDrives**; if not found, it's **created** in destination's `C:`.

<Note>
  If destination **C: drive** lacks sufficient space, operation will **fail**.\
  In that case, transfer **records only** and copy audio manually with **File Manager** (when going on air, AUDICOM corrects registered location).\
  File Manager's **second window** can be limited to one **drive** to facilitate copying and offers **Syncro** for folder synchronization.
</Note>

<Note>
  Units must be declared in **UNC** format.\
  If local units are referenced as **DOS letters**, they're interpreted in their **UNC equivalent**.\
  Ex.: if `audicom.ini` contains `AudioDrives=CD`, InfoMusic-Prod will interpret it as\
  `\\terminal_name\C; \\terminal_name\D`.
</Note>

- **Don't copy audio**:\
  Transfers **only** DB **references**.\
  Files remain in Production or original location where registered.
