### Load PGM ON/OFF

- With **Load PGM** enabled (default), CyberPlay builds the final schedule using program guides created in **CyberPlay Editor** (`.pgm`).
- If **Load PGM** is disabled, CyberPlay ignores `.pgm` files and uses only commercial breaks.

  The operator can insert content between breaks or use **Playlist Manager**.

<Note>
  The Configuration Panel allows enabling automatic removal of **pauses** at the end of each commercial block.
</Note>

### Reload: Changes in Programming Schedule

- CyberPlay automatically loads programming files daily.
- Daily loading of **LOG** and **PGM** occurs at **18:00** (configurable in Configuration Panel).
- Programming can be **manually reloaded** for last-minute changes.

Cases when Reload should be used:

- Modifications to current day's schedule.
- Changes to next day's schedule after automatic reload time.

Usage:

- Operator presses **RELOAD** or uses shortcut `[Alt + R]`.
- During reload:
  - Current title continues playing but disappears from CyberPlay window.
  - When finished, green cursor positions at most appropriate item based on time.
  - Operator can:

    Force start with Play.

    Take no action: system will continue with new schedule after current title.

<Note>
  - If **LOG** is modified, RELOAD button flashes indicating change.
  - If a **PGM** or next day's LOG is modified, system doesn't notify: operator must be **informed** to reload.
  - Individual files (LOG or PGM) can also be reloaded by double-clicking corresponding field in CyberPlay display.
</Note>

### Save Log and autoLog

- Changes to commercial blocks are automatically saved to **LOG** file (_autoLog_ function).
- AutoLog **does not save** changes if:
  - User is not authorized to modify breaks.
  - LOG was externally modified and alarm is active (Reload button flashing).

The **Save LOG** button allows manual saving:

- Even if file was externally modified.
- Won't work if user lacks permissions.
- Requests confirmation before overwriting.

### Next Title Button `[Enter]`

- Selects title marked with yellow cursor as **next title** (green cursor).
- If no title selected, next will be the one below red cursor (currently playing).
- Can be selected by double-clicking time area (left column).
  - Double-clicking colored area plays in **CUE**.

### Insert AutoDJ

Inserts an **AutoDJ** block into programming.

- User defines **format**, start and end time.
- Commercial breaks within range remain intact.

### Mix `[Asterisk]`

Controls CyberPlay attenuation when another module (e.g. Live Assist) plays on same output.

- Available values: **100%, 50%, 25%, 10%** (toggle by pressing button).
- During video playback:
  - Attenuation affects only video audio.
  - If another module also plays video, only audio is mixed.

### Right-click Menu Options

Right-clicking a title shows these options:

- **CUE**: preview playback.
- **CUE End**: plays last 5 seconds.
- **Play**: starts playback respecting crossfade in music tracks.
- **Stop**: stops playback.
- **Fade & Play**: fades current audio and starts next.
- **Fade & Stop**: fades and stops current audio.
- **InfoMusic**: loads title in InfoMusic (only if in database).
- **Internet...**: opens browser to search title information.
- **Copy TANDA**: copies commercial break content.
- **Insert TANDA**: inserts empty break.
- **Insert Meteor**: inserts Meteor instruction.
- **Insert Pause**: inserts pause above selected title.
- **Insert Random**: randomly selects audio from defined folder.
