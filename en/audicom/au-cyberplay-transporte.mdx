### Intro

Countdown timer that indicates the duration of a song's introduction, which is the time before the vocalist begins singing.

- Helps the announcer know how long they can talk over the song intro.
- The **Intro** time is defined in the **InfoMusic Production** window and can be modified from **InfoMusic Air**.
- If titles have presentation files (**Partner**), the Intro time is crucial for adjusting these presentations.

### Crossfades

To the right of the **Intro** indicator, a circle progressively fills each time AUDICOM performs a crossfade between two audio files.

### Block

Shows the remaining time until the end of a block in minutes and seconds.

- A line above the numbers graphically indicates elapsed time.
- In live programs (manual mode), AUDICOM remains stopped during the block.
- The counter shows time remaining until the next commercial break as a warning.
- The operator must press **Play** to air the commercial break.

### Error

Indicates in minutes and seconds how far ahead or behind the programming is compared to the original schedule.

- In automatic mode, AUDICOM corrects the error when possible using commercial block tolerances.
- In manual mode, timing errors can occur due to different program or news durations.

Example:

- An error of **-05:00** indicates the next block will start 5 minutes earlier than scheduled.
- This information allows the operator to make corrections by adding or removing music, promos or spots.

### Expanded Mode

Allows widening the CyberPlay window to show more display information.

- **LOG**: Commercial break file loaded for the current day.
  - Double-click the field to open a window to load any `.log` file for the day.
- **PGM**: Program file loaded for the current day.
  - Double-click the field to open a window to load any `.pgm` file for the day.

### Comments Window

Shows additional data about the currently playing title:

- Artist and author.
- Notes or comments.

All data comes from the database.

- When 15 seconds remain in the current title, information for the next track appears.
- Also indicates if the title has associated files, like presentations.

### Pop-up Messages

If a user attempts a restricted operation, a pop-up message appears informing about the restriction.

- These messages disappear automatically after a few seconds.
- They can also be closed by clicking or pressing **ESC**.

Example: attempted playback from **File Manager** by an unauthorized user.

## Playback Controls

Below are the controls and operations for the CyberPlay window (On-Air Screen).\
Keyboard shortcuts are shown in brackets.

### Play `[spacebar / Home]`

**Autorun Mode**

- In case of restart after power failure, if **Autorun** is enabled:
  - AUDICOM starts as **auto** user.
  - If 1 minute passes without intervention, playback starts from the title closest to current time.
- Configured in **Configuration Panel \> Preferences**.

<Warning>
  For AUDICOM to run at computer startup, create a shortcut to `aire.exe` in Windows **Startup** menu.
</Warning>

<Note>
  Some stations create a "virtual autorun" by scheduling a **Satfill** block overnight.\
  This procedure is explained in _Overnight Transmission Break_.
