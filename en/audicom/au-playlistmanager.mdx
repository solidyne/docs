## Auxiliary playlists

You can work with pre-built title lists (**Playlists**).\
AUDICOM includes 4 auxiliary players called **PlayList Managers**, accessible from the **PLAYLIST 1** to **PLAYLIST 4** buttons in the toolbar.

## Creating and loading lists

- Titles can be dragged from any AUDICOM window to a PlayList Manager.
- The list is saved as a `.txt` file in the `\Audicom\PGM` folder.
- PlayList Manager supports **.m3u** and **.plt** format lists, editable with **CyberPlay Editor** (option: _Playlists_).

### How to create a list

1. Open a PlayList module (or use `[Alt + P]` for PlayList 1).
2. Drag titles from **Media Manager**, **InfoMusic**, **Live Assist** or **CyberPlay**.
3. Enter a name and press **Save**.

Lists are saved in `.txt` format in `\Audicom\PGM`.

### How to load an existing list

- Select it from the bottom dropdown menu.
- To add external lists, copy them directly to the `\Audicom\PGM` folder.

<Info>
  Titles appear in different colors according to their last air date.

  - Music (Class = Music in database): light blue background.
  - Promotional cuts: yellow background.
</Info>

PlayList Manager supports CyberPlay programming commands:

- Text comments.
- Pauses.
- Meteor instructions.\
  These are inserted from the right-click menu.

## Preview listening

- Double click on a title or **CUE** button → playback on preview monitoring channel.
- **StopCUE** button → stops playback.
- If **CUE** mode is activated from the display (double click to the left of the counter):
  - Audio is not reported on RDS/iRDS.
  - It is not logged in `.air` files either.

<Warning>
  This mode is not recommended in practice, but some operators use it to work directly with the console's CUE, treating each PlayList Manager as an independent player.
</Warning>

## Content broadcasting

Each PlayList Manager can be assigned to a different audio device, defined in the **Configuration Panel**, to route it to different channels of the mixing console.

- To send a title on air: select it and press **Play**.
- Normal mode: playback stops when finished.
- Continuous mode: plays all titles one after another.
  - Pauses can be inserted from the right-click menu.

### Playback controls

- Progress bar: allows moving within the file (left click).
- Slider control: adjusts speed (**Pitch**) ±5%.
- **Insert** button: inserts the entire list into CyberPlay, above the yellow cursor.
  - Titles are distributed respecting commercial blocks.
- Individual insertion: drag a title to the CyberPlay window.

<Note>
  - If no item is selected in CyberPlay, the list will not be inserted.
  - The comments window will show: _Define insertion point_.
</Note>

## Duration restrictions

<Danger>
  If a PlayList exceeds the program block duration, **only titles that fit until the block ends will be inserted**.\
  It does not extend to the next program.
</Danger>

Example:

- Inserting a 1-hour PlayList at 17:30 in a live block ending at 18:00.
- Only titles up to 18:00 will be inserted.
