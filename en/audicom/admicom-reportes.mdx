## Reports from Admicom

Admicom offers various reporting options that allow you to monitor campaigns, verify broadcasts, and obtain exportable documentation in different formats (print, Excel, or PDF).

### Sales Report

Generates a report of aired advertisements for a specific client within a date range.\
Access it from `Report -> Sales`.

Complete the following in the form:

- **Station** (if managing more than one).
- **Client**.
- **Date range**.

When clicking **Report**, it displays the details of advertisements corresponding to the client, sorted alphabetically. The report can be printed, exported to compatible Excel format, or saved as PDF.

### Agency Settlement

Provides a list of advertisements corresponding to an Advertising Agency.\
The report includes details of advertisements aired on each station (in multi-station installations).

Output options are: printing, Excel export, or PDF saving.

---

### Product Placement / Sponsorships

Generates a report of **Product Placement** and **Sponsorships** for a specific day.

---

### Break Profile

Displays graphically the density of commercial breaks throughout the day.\
This report is only available for already generated breaks. If attempting to generate a profile for a date without breaks, the message **"Break not found"** is shown.

- **Horizontal axis:** Hours of the day (0 to 24 Hrs).
- **Vertical axis:** Accumulated advertising minutes per hour.

The red line **Max** represents the maximum advertising limit allowed per hour, configured in `Station Configuration -> Station`.\
Admicom never exceeds this limit in automatically generated breaks, although it could be exceeded if a break is manually modified from other modules (example: CyberPlay Editor).

---

### Advertisement Campaign

Shows in simplified form the schedule of a commercial advertisement, indicating programmed appearances.

For reports based on actual on-air broadcasts, the **Aaudit** module is used, which generates reports from broadcast logs.\
The report can be printed, exported to compatible Excel format, or saved as PDF.

<Note>
  IMPORTANT: In addition to Admicom reports, the **Aaudit** module allows auditing and verification of actual on-air broadcasts.
