---

## Usage in On-Air Terminal

There are three main operation modes:

1. **Program monitoring**.
2. **Search and access** titles in the Database.
3. **Preview** files (CUE).

### Program Monitoring

- InfoMusic displays real-time information about the currently playing title.
- The operator can **modify parameters** and **save** to the Database (**Save** button) if their **user profile** allows it.

### Title Search and Access

- Press **Clear** to suspend monitoring and enter **Search mode** (button changes to **A/Z Search**).
- Set filters (Title, Artist, Genre, etc.) and press **Search**.

**Search Results**

- Displayed in resizable **auxiliary windows**.
- A second search opens a second window; third search replaces first window content; fourth replaces second, and so on.
- To work with **single window**, close window 1 before new search.
- To **retain** search in window 1 and use window 2 for new searches, close window 2 after each search.

**Insertion into CyberPlay**

- From results window you can **drag** titles to **CyberPlay**, or use **Insert Arrow** (inserts at **yellow cursor** in CyberPlay).

<Note>
  Menus (Genre, Artist, etc.) are **updated when opening** InfoMusic.\
  If new Genres/Artists are added in Production, they won't appear until InfoMusic is **closed and reopened** in On-Air.\
  For more information see **InfoMusic – Production**.
</Note>

## Fades, Intro and Start/End Marks

InfoMusic On-Air displays and edits:

- **Crossfade** of current title.
- **Intro** (time from music start to vocal entry).
- **Start/End** (playback **start** and **end** marks).

### Crossfade

- Crossfade times are stored in the **Database**.
- From On-Air you can change them **only for current instance** or **permanently** (**Save** button).
- Window shows **graphically** the title and how it overlaps with previous/next.
- Adjust by dragging **blue handles** (**0 to 5 s** overlap).

**Application Criteria**

- If two titles have different times, **shortest** is used.
- **Entry slope**: always 0 (_Fade In_ value is overlap time at start).
- **Exit slope**: automatically adjusted based on fade value for better artistic result.

**Change Persistence**

- **Save** writes to Database (if profile allows).
- Without saving, change applies only to **current inclusion** of title.

<Warning>
  Duration and crossfade modifications **only apply** from **second title** below currently playing.\
  If you edit the **playing title** or **immediate next**, changes are **ignored** (system pre-calculates fades for performance).
</Warning>

1. Press **Play** (in InfoMusic On-Air) to **preview**.
2. When intro ends, press **SET** → **INTRO** display shows value.
3. Pressing **SET** with CUE stopped resets value to **0**.
4. Fine adjustments with **arrows**:
