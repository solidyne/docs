## Operation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start recording">
    Press the **REC** button. Recording starts immediately.\
    The **I-REC** module appears on screen with a VU meter showing the input signal level.\
    <Warning>
      Make sure the last red lines of the VU meter do not light up to avoid signal clipping.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stop recording">
    - Click on the module image.
    - Or close the I-REC window (by pressing the button in the Toolbar again).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Move the window">
    Drag it from the title bar (Instant Recorder).\
    <Note>
      It is recommended to move it only when not recording, since clicking on the image stops the recording.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  The module always opens in the same position where it was closed.

### File Names

There are two modes:

- **Automatic**:\
  I-REC assigns names when recording ends without operator intervention.\
  Format: `YYMMDD HHMMSS` (Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, Second).
- **Operator defined**:\
  Enable the **N** on the left of the VU meter.\
  A dialog box will appear to enter the name before saving.

## Configuration

Access by **right-clicking** on the module.\
<Warning>
  While the configuration window is open, I-REC will not record.
</Warning>

### Audio Input

- The sound card is selected during installation in the **Configuration Panel**.
- To modify: run **aConfig** from the toolbar or installation folder.
- In the _Instant Recording I-Rec_ field select the recording device (line input recommended).

### Sample Rate (Hz)

- **44,100 / 32,000**: high quality.
- **22,050**: archival material without high demands.
- **11,025 or less**: telephone lines.

<Note>
  I-REC does not compress audio.\
  One minute of stereo at 44,100 Hz takes ~10 MB.
</Note>

### Channels

Define whether the recording will be **mono** or **stereo**.

### Directory

- Folder where recorded files will be saved.
- A **local disk** is recommended.
- Must be part of the AUDICOM structure to appear in **File Manager**.
- Factory setting: `C:\Audicom\Audio\I-REC`.

### Loop Recorder

- In this mode, I-REC keeps the last **N minutes** of the program in memory.
- To record to disk: left click on the module.
- The filename can be automatic or operator defined.
- Loop mode is indicated by the **red L** on the right of the VU meter.

<Info>
  I-REC can remain in Loop mode for many hours, as it does not use the disk and only requires memory for the configured minutes.
</Info>

  I-REC only works on the **air desktop**.\
  It is not available on AUDICOM general desktop (`Desktop.exe`).
