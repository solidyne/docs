## General Concepts

**CyberPlay** automatically creates the radio's daily event schedule with exact timing.

<img

  alt="AUDICOM CyberPlay Screen"
  title="AUDICOM CyberPlay Screen"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"37%" }}
/>

- The window displays the **complete programming grid from 00:00 to 24:00**, including all events, not just computer-controlled ones.
- Traditional programming blocks are preserved: live shows, news, reports, remote connections, etc.

CyberPlay can operate in:

- **Commercial break** mode, managing only advertising blocks.
- Full mode, based on the **PGM programming grid**.

To generate a full year of programming (365 days), only **7 templates** are required, one for each day of the week.

- These are created using simple commands in the **CyberPlay Editor** module.
- Special day templates can also be defined.

AUDICOM's Traffic module creates a daily commercial break list in the format:\
`YYMMDD.LOG` (Year, Month, Day).

CyberPlay merges and displays both lists (commercials and programming) as a single unified list.

<Note>
  CyberPlay loads the **LOG** and **PGM** files at 18:00 each day.\
  This time can be modified from the Configuration Panel.
</Note>

The CyberPlay window shows programming for the current day, previous day, and next day.

- The list can be navigated using the scroll bar.

### Color Identification

Different content types are distinguished on screen by colors:

- **Green**: commercial break
- **Yellow**: live block
- **Blue**: AutoDJ block
- **Pink**: remote link (satellite or Internet)
- **Purple**: Exacttime
- **Black**: pause (stop point)

### Time Identification

- Even hours: light gray background
- Odd hours: dark gray background
- Previous day: hours in blue
- Current day: hours in black
- Next day: hours in red

### Playback Cursor

- Red line indicates the title currently playing
- Played titles appear in gray
- Cursor has automatic centering, returning to screen if hidden
- If an item is selected, cursor changes to yellow and centering is temporarily suspended for 1 minute
- An arrow on the vertical bar indicates if the playing title is out of view

  Clicking the arrow forces centering on the playing title.

## Commercial Blocks

Contains advertisements. Each block equals one commercial break.

Block example:

<img
  src="/images/audicom/au-screen-spots.png"
  alt="Commercial block"
  title="Commercial block"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"59%" }}
/>

```
00:00    				Air time
SF5     			 	Break time flexibility
Spot1; Spot2; Spot3  	Commercial spot files
Meteor: Time         	Special command that announces current time
```

---

## Program Blocks

Correspond to radio content:

- Live shows
- Automated music programming (**AutoDJ**)
- Remote links (satellite or Internet)

Block header example:

```
[Live]                  Block type
18:00-18:00             Start and end time
<no title>              Block name (untitled in this case)
Program Length: ...     Program duration
```
