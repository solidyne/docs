- Audio files are organized in button grids.
- Each profile has 12 pages or tabs.
- The number of buttons per page depends on rows and columns defined in the **Configuration Panel**.
- The panel can be resized and button sizes adjust automatically.

Live Assist supports control from:

- Keyboard (see _Keyboard Control_ section).
- External controllers via **MIDI**.

### Audio Devices

- Can be assigned independent output devices or share the same as **CyberPlay**.
- When sharing, mixing is done internally according to **MIX** value.
- Assignment is done from the **Configuration Panel**.

### Video

In **Audicom Black Video**, Live Assist also supports video playback.

- Does not interrupt or overlap with videos playing through CyberPlay or PlayList Manager.



## Output Devices

Both modules can play through internal mix with CyberPlay or through independent outputs.\
Assignment is done from the **Configuration Panel**.



## Expanded View

You can toggle between compact and expanded views.

- Toggle using the **Maximize** button in the title bar.



## Pause, Stop and Fade-Stop

- **Pause**: stops playback and allows resuming with Play.
- **Stop**: completely stops and returns to start.

## Preview (Cue)

- Right click on a button → plays in **CUE** through dedicated channel.
- Hold right click \>1s also activates CUE.

<Warning>
  Console CUE mode is not recommended:

- **Normal**:
  - Plays once.
  - If another file is triggered, it queues (flashing text).
- **Loop**:
  - Continuous loop playback.
  - Stops with Stop or changing modes.
- **Instant**:
  - If another button is triggered, interrupts previous playback.

### Chain to Air

  - Trigger one or more Live Assist buttons.
  - Then press the chain to air button.
- Window closes and after sequence ends, Air playlist continues.

  From keyboard, same operation using **spacebar** after triggering a file.
