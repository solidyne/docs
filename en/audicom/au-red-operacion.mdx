Let's continue with a **peer-to-peer** network example, consisting of five terminals and one server:

1. AM Terminal — `"AM"`
2. FM Terminal — `"FM"`
3. Production Studio — `"Produccion"`
4. News Production — `"Noticias"`
5. Commercial Administration — `"Comercial"`
6. Audio Server — `"ServerSolidyne"`

Each computer has access to **local** disks (own) and **network** disks (other terminals), always through **UNC** references.

**AM, FM, Production, News and Commercial Terminals**

- **C:** not shared; partition dedicated to OS and AUDICOM.
- **D:** `Audicom` folder shared with read/write access.

**Server**

- **C:** not shared; partition dedicated to OS.
- **D:** `Audicom` folder shared with read/write access.
- **E:** `Audicom` folder shared with read/write access.

## Data access between terminals

Modules like **CyberPlay Editor**, **AutoDj Editor** and **InfoMusic-Prod** allow working from one terminal on another terminal's data, thanks to the **Current Terminal** dropdown menu:

- `"Default host"`: references the local terminal, unless redefined in `audicom.ini`.
- The first time, the system scans the network to detect active terminals (may take time).
- The result is cached, avoiding subsequent delays.
- To refresh the list use the **\_update hosts...** option.

---

## Audio Files and Database

- **Music and presentations** → stored on the **Server**.
- **Spots, promos, Database and programming files** → local to each On-Air terminal (to continue operating if network fails).

**Synchronized Databases (SDB)** are used:

- Each on-air terminal has its own Database.
- Production works directly on the On-Air Databases.
- File organization is detailed in _File Organization_.

## File registration

Recommended workflow:

1. Titles are recorded and edited in Production.
2. They are sent to the destination terminal (music, spots, promos).
3. They are registered in the corresponding Database.

Example:

- File `Tu nos has elejido.wav` is recorded in Production.
- It is edited and prepared for broadcast.
- From File Manager, open the FM terminal (`\\FM\Audicom`).
- Move the file to FM (drag & drop; `Ctrl` to copy).
- In InfoMusic-Prod, select the FM terminal.
- Register the file as **New** (using UNC path).
- The file becomes available only on FM.

<Note>
  Usually **commercial spots** are not registered in the Database, unless you want to apply crossfades between spots.
</Note>

## Programming setup

If programming is generated from **Commercial**:

- **CyberPlay Editor, AutoDj Editor, InfoMusic-Prod, File Manager** → allow selecting the **current terminal**.
- **Admicom**:
  - "Admicom AM" generates commercial logs (`.log`) for AM terminal.
  - "Admicom FM" generates commercial logs (`.log`) for FM.
- Example:
  - To program FM, select FM in CyberPlay Editor.
  - Files are saved to `\\FM\Audicom\Log` and `\\FM\Audicom\Pgm`.
- AutoDj Editor saves formats to `autodj.ini` of each On-Air terminal.

<Note>
  When inserting titles in CyberPlay Editor, File Manager or InfoMusic, the **correct terminal** must be selected, or you risk programming titles not available at that station.
</Note>

## File organization

### Single On-Air terminal

- All files reside on the **On-Air PC**.
- They are generated in Production and then transferred to the On-Air Database through **InfoMusic-Prod**.
- When exporting from Production → files are **copied** to On-Air PC (duplicated).
- It's recommended to keep **promos and station IDs** duplicated, as they take little space and are difficult to replace.

<Note>
  All audio folders must be inside `\Audicom\Audio`.\
  Any folder outside this path will be ignored by AUDICOM.
</Note>

### Multiple On-Air terminals

- Music → stored on the **Server** (or a terminal acting as server).
- Commercials, promos, fillers and station IDs → **duplicated on each On-Air terminal**, ensuring local operation if network fails.
- Distribution is done from Production, via **File Manager** and **InfoMusic-Prod**.
- Avoid folders with the same name on different terminals to prevent conflicts.

### Folders structure

The audio files are organized in folders. Each folder has a **category** assigned in File Manager. The categories are:

- **MUS** → Music
- **COM** → Commercials
- **PRO** → Promos
- **COR** → Station IDs
- **RX** → Fillers

<Note>
  The folder names can be customized, but the categories are fixed.
</Note>

The folder structure is:

```
\Audicom\Audio\
    ├── MUSICA\
    │   ├── ROCK\
    │   ├── POP\
    │   └── JAZZ\
    ├── COMERCIALES\
    │   ├── ACTIVOS\
    │   └── VENCIDOS\
    ├── PROMOS\
    │   ├── CONCURSOS\
    │   └── EVENTOS\
    ├── CORTINAS\
    └── RELLENOS\
```

<Note>
  The folder names can be in any language. The above structure is just an example.
</Note>

### Folder categories

The categories are assigned in **File Manager**. To assign a category:

1. Right-click on a folder
2. Select "Properties"
3. Choose the category from the dropdown menu
4. Click "Apply"

<Warning>
  - All folders must have a category assigned
  - A folder can only have one category
  - Sub-folders inherit the category from their parent folder
</Warning>

### Folder names

- Use short names without spaces
- Avoid special characters
- Maximum length: 8 characters
- Use uppercase letters

Example: `MUSROCK`, `MUSJAZZ`, `COMPUB`, `PROMOS`

<Note>
  While longer names and spaces are supported, short names make file management easier.
