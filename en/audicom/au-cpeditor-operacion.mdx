## Loading and Saving Files

### Individual Loading of LOG / PGM Files

This procedure applies to both **LOG** and **PGM** windows.\
It allows loading files individually, although they can also be loaded together (see next section).

When pressing the load button, a window appears with dropdown menus to select:\
**Day – Day of the week – Month – Year**.\
You can also select a file directly from the list on the right.

<Info>
  File names always correspond to the date for which they were generated, as explained in the previous section.
</Info>

---

## Loading Complete Programming by Date

When **CyberPlay Editor** opens, it automatically loads the **commercial breaks** and **program blocks** files for the **current day**.

The **load by date** button allows simultaneous selection of **LOG** and **PGM** files for a specific date.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Load programming by date">
    Click the corresponding button and select the date in the calendar.\
    Confirm with **OK**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Result">
    CyberPlay Editor will load LOG and PGM files following the priority order explained in the previous section.\
    It will then generate a **graphical preview** in the **Test CyberPlay** window.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Subsequent editing">
    Once loaded, LOG and PGM files can be edited and saved independently.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Saving LOG / PGM Files

Pressing this button saves changes made to a LOG or PGM file.\
The save window is similar to the one used for loading files.

- To create a **new file**, enter a name and press **OK**.
- If the name doesn't exist, a new file will be created for the specified date.
- If it already exists, a dialog box will appear to confirm replacement. Accepting will overwrite the previous file.

<Note>
  The **Year** field always shows: the previous year and the two years following the current year.\
  AUDICOM includes **sample files** (7 LOG and 7 PGM), which should be deleted to avoid interference with actual programming.
</Note>

## PlayLists – Title Lists

Within the **Save PGM** window, there is a specific button for saving **PlayLists**, which are title lists in **TXT** format that can be inserted into the on-air programming schedule.

- When pressing the button, a box appears to enter the **PlayList** name.
- This name will be displayed by the **PlayList Manager**, which manages these lists in the On-Air module.
- PlayLists are always saved in the **PGM** folder.

When checking the **Show PlayList only** box, the window will display only this type of files.

<Info>
  Playlists can also be created directly by operators from the On-Air screen using the **PlayList Manager**.
</Info>

## Entering Titles in LOG and PGM Windows

There are three ways to enter titles in the **LOG** and **PGM** editing windows:

- **Manual typing** (writing directly).
- **Drag & Drop** from **File Manager**.
- **Drag & Drop** from **InfoMusic**.

---

## Programming Test (F9)

The **CyberPlay preview** window graphically shows how the **programming schedule** is organized.

- When pressing **Test**, the graph is generated based on commands entered in **LOG** and **PGM**.
- The graph simulates what the **On-Air operator** will see.
- Simultaneously, a **validation** of the programming is performed, and results are shown in the **STATUS** window below LOG and PGM.

---

### Test-CyberPlay Window

The **Test-CyberPlay** window allows you to **verify and modify** entered commands.

When pressing **TEST**, the following aspects are verified:

- **Scheduled files**:
  - If a title doesn't correspond to any file, it appears in **RED**.
  - In the On-Air module, that file will be **ignored**, marked as error, and playback will continue with the next one.
- **AutoDJ Formats**:
  - The existence of assigned formats is validated.
  - If a format doesn't exist, it appears in **STATUS** and must be corrected from PGM.
  - If not corrected, the block will be built with the **Default** format, which includes all styles available in the Database.

### Listening to Scheduled Titles

From the **Programming Terminal** (requires installed sound card):

- Select a title in the **CyberPlay** window.
- Press **PLAY** to preview it.

---

## Changing the Schedule from the Preview Window

The **preview window** allows direct modification of various aspects of the **programming schedule**.

- **Right-click on an item** opens a menu with the following options:
  - **PLAY / STOP** → Playback controls (if the item is an audio file).
  - **INSERT METEOR** → Inserts a **METEOR** instruction above the selected item.
  - **INSERT PAUSE** → Inserts a **PAUSE** above the selected item.
  - **REMOVE** → Removes the selected item.
    - For a **commercial spot**, only **that occurrence** is removed.
    - To remove **all occurrences** of the spot, use **Magic Programming** (this function will soon be available in the context menu as well).
    - Complete blocks cannot be deleted from this menu.
- Each change made in the preview window automatically generates the **corresponding code** in the **LOG** or **PGM** window (as appropriate).
- **Double-click** on an item in CyberPlay shows the **code line** that generates it in the corresponding instructions window.

### Changing File Positions

You can **reorder scheduled files**:

- Click on a title and drag it up or down.
- You can also drag **pauses** or **Meteor commands**.
- **Commercial breaks and program blocks cannot be moved**.

To change the **start or end time** of a block:

- Double-click on the **block header** → the code is shown in LOG or PGM.
- Directly edit the code line with the desired time.

<Warning>
  Always visually verify the programming.\
  Errors such as **time overlaps**, **gaps**, or **non-existent titles** must be corrected.\
  Otherwise, programming in the **On-Air Module** will be incorrect.
</Warning>

## Multiple On-Air Terminals

From a **Production terminal**, you can **navigate and operate** on any of the network terminals. This is useful when there are multiple active On-Air terminals, as it allows managing the programming of either one.

<img
  src="/images/audicom/au-cpeditor-terminales.jpg"
  alt="Au Cpeditor Terminales Jp"
  title="Au Cpeditor Terminales Jp"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"58%" }}
/>

- The **"Current terminal"** dropdown menu shows all available terminals.
- The **"Default host"** value always points to the **local terminal**, unless the administrator redefines the default configuration in `audicom.ini`.
- If you select an **On-Air terminal**, its **programming files** will be displayed, allowing you to work directly with its **LOG/PGM**.

<Info>
  When deploying the menu for the first time, the system scans the network for **active AUDICOM terminals**.\
  This process may take a few seconds, but the result is stored in memory, speeding up subsequent access.
</Info>

To update the list of available terminals, select the **\_update hosts** option.
