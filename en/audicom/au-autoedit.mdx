Avoiding silences at the beginning and end of files prevents unexpected **dead air** during broadcast. **AutoEdit** removes these silences **automatically** and, most importantly, can **edit MP3s without recompression**, fully preserving quality (recompressing an MP3 re-encodes it and degrades the audio).

**Supported formats:** WAV PCM (uncompressed), MP3 (MPEG Layer III), WAV-MP3 (`.wav` files that are internally MP3) and any other format whose **CODEC** is installed on the system.

## Using AutoEdit

### Source folder

Specify the folder containing the files to process (by default, the **CD Ripper** folder).\
Use **Choose** to open the folder and select a file; its name will appear in the **File** field (see next point).

### File

Shows the **full name** of the selected file. You can:

- **Process just that file**, or
- Expand the selection with **wildcards** (`*`) to include multiple files.

**"Generic Name" (selection pattern) — Step by step example:**

1. Select (via **Choose Source Directory**) the file\
   `"Kraftwerk - Expo 2000 (Radio Mix).mp3"`\
   → that exact name appears in **File**.
2. Press **Generic Name** → field changes to `Kraftwerk -*.mp3`\
   → **all files** starting with `Kraftwerk -` will be processed.
3. Press **Generic Name** again → `K*.mp3`\
   → **all** files starting with `K` will be processed.
4. Press once more → `*.mp3`\
   → **all** MP3s in the folder will be processed.

<Note>
  For music files, always use the naming pattern `Artist - Title.mp3`.\
  This facilitates automatic loading into the Database.
</Note>

### Destination folder

According to settings (see **Settings**), edited files can:

- Remain in the **source folder**, or
- Be saved to a **destination folder** (default: `AutoEdit`).

### Process

Starts editing. AutoEdit removes **input** and **output** silences very quickly.

- AutoEdit works **directly on compressed audio**, **without conversions** → **no quality loss**.
- Silence detection **thresholds** are **fixed** (tested with diverse musical material).
- Results appear in the **Results** window: time removed at start/end, **total duration** and **location** of edited file.\
  Use the **Expand** button (red double arrow) to see detailed report.

### Settings

Key configuration options:

- **Use destination directory = source directory**:\
  Edited files are saved **in the same source folder**.
- **Delete original file**:\
  If enabled, the original is **deleted** after editing (only edited version remains).\
  If edited files stay in source folder, originals are **renamed** with `BAK` prefix keeping **the extension** (e.g., `.mp3`).
- **Ignore files older than N days**:\
  Allows processing **only** **recent** files. Enter number of days (e.g., `2` → processes files from **last two days**).

### Play

Plays the file selected in **Results**.\
If you press **Play** while already playing, the **last 10 seconds** are played (useful for checking the ending).\
Playback is not possible while AutoEdit is **processing**.

## AutoEdit and Database

If processing files **already registered** in the Database (for example, the entire `Jazz` folder), enable **"destination directory = source directory"** so the path **doesn't change**.

For added safety, you can **disable** "Delete original file".\
The Database **automatically updates** with the **new durations**; **Intro** times are also corrected if applicable.

<Note>
  **Networks:** for Database updates to work, load files in AutoEdit using **Network Environment** (**UNC** reference).\
  **Correct** example: `\\Production\C\Audicom\Audio\CD-Ripper`\
  **Incorrect** example: `C:\Audicom\Audio\CD-Ripper` (in this case, DB will **not** update).
</Note>

## Batch Processing

AutoEdit can process multiple files simultaneously. The **Results** window shows:

- **File name**
- **Original duration**
- **Final duration**
- **Difference** (in seconds)
- **Status** (OK/Error)

Files are processed in order. You can **cancel** the process at any time - files already processed will remain modified.

### Results Window

The **Results** window displays:

- **Green**: Successfully processed files
- **Red**: Files with errors
- **Yellow**: Files pending processing

Double-click on a file to play it. Right-click for additional options:

- **Play**: Plays selected file
- **Delete**: Removes file from list
- **Clear list**: Removes all files
- **Save log**: Exports results to text file

### Error Messages

Common error messages:

- **"File not found"**: Source file missing/inaccessible
- **"Access denied"**: File in use/insufficient permissions
- **"Invalid format"**: Unsupported audio format
- **"Processing error"**: General processing failure

For network files, ensure proper access permissions and stable connection.

<Note>
  If many files show errors, check:
  - Source folder permissions
  - Network connectivity
  - Available disk space
  - Audio file formats
</Note>

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Test first**: Process a few sample files before large batches
- **Backup**: Keep originals until verifying results
- **Network**: Use UNC paths for reliable database updates
- **Space**: Ensure sufficient disk space for temporary files
- **Monitoring**: Check Results window for processing status
- **Verification**: Sample-check processed files for quality

<Warning>
  When processing large batches:
  - Do not interrupt network connection
  - Avoid system sleep/hibernation
  - Keep sufficient free disk space
  - Monitor Results window for errors
</Warning>
