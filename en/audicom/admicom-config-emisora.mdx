Admicom allows managing commercial scheduling for one or multiple stations in the **AUDICOM Multicast** version.\
Each station has a general configuration that defines the **maximum advertising minutes per hour** and the **commercial break distribution grid**.

When opening the application, an empty Admicom desktop is displayed. Different configuration options are accessed through the menus.

## Station

This section is used to enter and modify data for each station. By default, a single station called **DEMO** appears.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Main Data">
    - **Code**: Identification or abbreviation up to 10 characters (example: `AM1030`).
    - **Name**: Station name (example: _Radio America_).
    - **Maximum break duration**: Limit of advertising minutes per hour. This value is never exceeded; excess spots are rejected based on priority.
    - **Output path**: Folder where commercial schedule `.log` files are generated.
    - **Audio path**: Folder where advertising audio files are stored.
    - **Image**: Logo or symbol displayed in reports.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Controls">
    - **Search**: Locates an existing station.
    - **Modify**: Changes current station data.
    - **New**: Creates a new station.
    - **Delete**: Removes selected station.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  To delete a station, all associated spots and breaks must be deleted first.\
  A quick method is to clear one day and then use **Copy day** to replicate the empty configuration to the rest of the week.
</Note>

## Commercial Break

Allows defining the **commercial break distribution** for each station and each day of the week.

- **Station**: Selects the station.
- **Day of week**: Defines the day to modify.
- **Copy Station**: Copies the grid from another station.
- **Copy day**: Duplicates distribution from one day to others in the week.

### Break Definition

- Create a break: **New**.
- Edit existing break: **Edit** or **Modify**.
- **Time ref.**: Can be defined as start or end of commercial block.
- **Tolerance**: Minutes that the block can be advanced or delayed relative to scheduled time.
- **Allow mixing categories**: Authorizes spots of the same category to share a break; otherwise, they are relocated.

## Programs

Here the schedules for the selected station's programs are defined.

- **Program**: Code and name (must be previously created in _Configuration -> Program_).
- **Start Time / End Time**: Program time range.
- Scheduled spots are automatically inserted in this block.

## Announcers

Allows registering announcer names in the database, which streamlines loading in commercial spot forms.

- **Code**: Abbreviation up to 10 characters.
- **Name**: Announcer's full name.

## Programs (General Definition)

Here programs or segments are registered in the Admicom database, independent of schedule or station.

- **Code**: Short identification (max. 10 characters).
- **Name**: Complete program name.

<Note>
  Start and end times are configured from **Configuration -> Commercial break**.\
  If a program changes day or time, associated spots are automatically rescheduled.
