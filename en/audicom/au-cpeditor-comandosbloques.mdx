## Live Blocks (LIVE)

**Syntax:**

`/Block /HH:MM-HH:MM /Live [Block Title]`

**Detailed Description**\
A live block defines a programming segment where hosting and content are manually managed on-air, while **AUDICOM only schedules and manages commercial breaks**. During the block, the On-Air screen displays a **countdown** indicating the time remaining until the next break. When **less than one minute** remains, a **red line** appears over the counter that **grows progressively**, indicating the proximity of the break. This indication is **informative**: the operator must **press Play** to start the break when appropriate (it does not trigger automatically in LIVE mode).

**Command Parameters**

`/HH:MM-HH:MM`

→ Block **start** and **end** time (24h format).

`/Live`

→ Indicates that the block is **live** (manual).

`[Block Title]`

→ **Optional**; allows naming the block (up to **32 characters**). Brackets are not written in the file: they only indicate that the title is optional.

**Example**\\

`/Block /17:00-20:00 /Live SUNSET INTERVIEWS`

Live block that starts at **17:00** and ends at **20:00**. During this period, AUDICOM will only manage commercial breaks; the rest of the content (music, jingles, microphone) is handled by the operator in real-time.

## MetaNames for Pre-recorded Content Programming

Designed for including pre-recorded or _"canned"_ content acquired from external producers. These programs are downloaded from the Internet in compressed audio formats and need to be scheduled for broadcast in the most automated way possible.

With the introduction of **MetaNames in AUDICOM**, this task can be fully automated.

### Problem Before MetaNames

Traditionally, each pre-recorded file had a different name according to the day of the week, requiring different block programming for each day.\
Typical example of a daily program divided into four 15-minute blocks:

Your_40_Favorites_Monday-Block1.mp3
Your_40_Favorites_Monday-Block2.mp3
Your_40_Favorites_Monday-Block3.mp3
Your_40_Favorites_Monday-Block4.mp3

When the day changed, the names also changed (`Tuesday`, `Wednesday`, etc.), requiring duplicate programming.

### Solution with MetaNames

Thanks to MetaNames, it's possible to define a generic block valid for the entire week, regardless of the day.

Example:

```
/Block /10:00-11:00 /Live Pre-recorded Program Your 40 Favorites\
Your_40_Favorites_\<dia\>-Block1.mp3\
Your_40_Favorites_\<dia\>-Block2.mp3\
Your_40_Favorites_\<dia\>-Block3.mp3\
Your_40_Favorites_\<dia\>-Block4.mp3
```

In this case, AUDICOM automatically replaces `<dia>` with the corresponding day of the week: _Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday_, etc. This eliminates the need to create separate programming files.

### Available MetaNames

MetaNames can be combined in different ways, allowing adaptation to multiple file naming schemes:

- `<d>` → Day of month in single digit (1–31)
- `<dd>` → Day of month in two digits (01–31)
- `<dia>` → Full weekday name
- `<dia3>` → Abbreviated weekday name (Mon, Tue, etc.)
- `<m>` → Month number (1–12)
- `<mm>` → Month number in two digits (01–12)
- `<mes>` → Full month name
- `<mes3>` → Abbreviated month name (Jan, Feb, etc.)
- `<aa>` → Year in two digits (11, 12, etc.)
- `<aaaa>` → Year in four digits (2011, 2012, etc.)
- `<s>` → Week number within the month

### Example with Hourly News

MetaNames are also useful for **news services**. Consider files downloaded from a news agency like TELAM (Argentina):

BULLETIN-09hrs-20120307.mp3
BULLETIN-10hrs-20120307.mp3
BULLETIN-11hrs-20120307.mp3

With MetaNames, programming can be defined generically as:

```
/Exacttime /09:00\
BULLETIN-09hrs-\<aaaa\>\<mm\>\<dd\>.mp3

/Exacttime /10:00\
BULLETIN-10hrs-\<aaaa\>\<mm\>\<dd\>.mp3

/Exacttime /11:00\
BULLETIN-11hrs-\<aaaa\>\<mm\>\<dd\>.mp3
```

Here, AUDICOM automatically replaces the values of `<aaaa>`, `<mm>` and `<dd>` with the broadcast date.

### Complete Automation

In addition to MetaNames, AUDICOM incorporates tools that enable automated downloading of these files from the Internet, making it possible for the complete operation —download, update, and programming— to be performed entirely automatically.

---

## Direct Inclusion

**Direct inclusion** allows, within a **LIVE** or **AutoDj** block, to **pre-program a list of files** that will appear in the On-Air Screen ready for playback, **in the written order** below the block line. It's ideal for short "canned" content, fixed jingles, micro-content, or specific songs that must play within an automated or live segment.

#### Basic Example (LIVE block)

```
/Block /12:00-24:00 /Live
Dead Leaf Echo
Denn die todten reiten schnell
Corvus Corax - Bacchus
Zauberquelle
Psyche
```

**How it executes:**

- Titles written immediately **below** the block are inserted **as is** in the schedule and played in that order.
- If the **duration** of the list **exceeds** the available time until the next **break**, **AUDICOM gives way to the break** and, upon completion, **continues** with the remaining titles.
- In the On-Air Screen, you'll see the items as scheduled, with **breaks interspersed** at their corresponding times.

#### Allowable Commands with Files

Besides titles, you can insert **Meteor** family commands, **pauses**, **comments**, and **random selection**:

- **Meteor** (time and weather):\
  `/Time`, `/Temp`, `/Hum`, `/Pres`, `/Rain`, `/Meteor`
- **Pauses**:\
  `/Pause` (simple pause), `/Text ...` (pause with text and estimated duration)
- **Comments** (informative lines that don't play):\
  Start with `;`
- **Random** from a folder:\
  `/RND,Folder,n*prefix`

These commands **coexist** with the titles listed under the block and execute in the **same sequence**.

---

### Direct Inclusion in AutoDj Blocks

It's also possible to **force one or more titles** at the start (or within) an automatic block and let **AutoDj complete the rest** to fit the time.

**Example (fixed title at the start of each hour; AutoDj fills the rest):**

`/Block /00:00-01:00 /AutoDJ="classical" Dawn`\
Message1

`/Block /01:00-02:00 /AutoDJ="classical" Dawn2`\
Message2

`/Block /02:00-03:00 /AutoDJ="classical" Dawn3`\
Message3

**Behavior:**

- The **first item** of each block (Message1/Message2/Message3) is **fixed**.
- The **time difference** until completing the hour is filled by **AutoDj** with music from the specified **format**.
- The result is **predictable** (always starts with the message) and **adjusted** (AutoDj compensates times and avoids gaps).

---

### Automatic "Message" Rotation with RANDOM

If instead of a single fixed "MessageX" per hour you want to **automatically vary it every day**, use **/RND** to **randomly** choose a file from a folder:

`/Block /00:00-01:00 /AutoDJ="classical" Dawn`\
`/RND,messagesFolder1,1`

`/Block /01:00-02:00 /AutoDJ="classical" Dawn2`\
`/RND,messagesFolder2,1`

`/Block /02:00-03:00 /AutoDJ="classical" Dawn3`\
`/RND,messagesFolder3,1`

**Notes about RANDOM:**

- The third parameter indicates **how many items** to insert (here, **1**).
- The **selection doesn't use** the Database or play dates; it's **purely random** within the **folder**.
- Optionally can restrict by **prefix** with `*` (e.g.: `/RND,Spots,2*ID` for files starting with "ID…").

---

### Direct Inclusion for "Pinpointing" at Specific Times

When you need **certain files to play around specific times**, a clean technique is to **divide the broad segment** into **several contiguous blocks** and **put the title(s) below** each block, leaving **AutoDj** to fill:

**Example (three hours, each with a different message at the start):**

```
/Block /00:00-01:00 /AutoDJ="classical" Dawn
Message1
/Block /01:00-02:00 /AutoDJ="classical" Dawn2
Message2
/Block /02:00-03:00 /AutoDJ="classical" Dawn3
Message3
```

**Advantages:**

- Guarantees the **appearance** of the element in the **desired segment** without breaking time logic.
- **AutoDj** handles **compensation** and **timely closing** of each block.
- If there are also **breaks**, AUDICOM **respects** them and **resumes** the scheduled sequence afterward.

---

### Best Practices

- **Order and reading**: the Editor's **preview screen (TEST)** shows exactly how titles, breaks, and commands will **interleave**; use it to **validate**.
- **Existing files**: if a title in the list **doesn't exist** on the audio servers, it will appear in **red** (and will be **skipped** on-air).
- **Breaks**: direct inclusion **doesn't displace** breaks; if there's no time, the break **interrupts** and then the block **continues**.
- **Volume and mixing**: if you need to "overlap" music with jingles/sponsors use **AutoDj blocks** with **/Sponsor** or **ExactTime** with the `+` operator and `/SS/KK` parameters (see corresponding sections).

---

## Special Inclusion (ExactTime)

The `/ExactTime` instruction allows scheduling events at a specific time **within a block**. It's useful for fixed or recurring content (sponsors, music sections, micro-programs, news, "song of the week", etc.).

Syntax:
`/ExactTime [Name] /HH:MM SYZ`

Parameters:

- `[Name]`: Optional event identification (up to 32 characters).
- `/HH:MM`: Time when it should air (hours and minutes).
- `SYZ`: Flexibility variables, equivalent to those of Breaks:
  - `S` or `E`: defines if the time corresponds to the start (Start) or end (End) of the event.
  - `C` or `F`: indicates if execution is at exact time (Clock) or flexible (Flexible).
  - `Z`: tolerance minutes for flexible events.

<Note>
  If flexibility is not specified, the default value is `SF5` (flexible start ±5 minutes).
</Note>

### Behavior in CyberPlay:

- `/ExactTime` events are shown in purple, similar to a Break.
- Breaks have priority over `/ExactTime`. If times coincide with equal priority, `/ExactTime` is relocated after the break. If flexibilities differ, the one with less tolerance is scheduled first.
- Within an `/ExactTime` all Break commands can be used: `/Time`, `/Rnd`, `/Pause`, `/Text`, comments `;`, chained events `@`, etc.
- MetaNames are supported (e.g., for audio that changes by date/day). To avoid markup errors, always write them between quotes or using backticks: `<dd>`, `<mm>`, `<aaaa>` → `"<dd>"`, `"<mm>"`, `"<aaaa>"`.

**Example 1** — AutoDj block with hourly messages:

```
/Block /00:00-06:00 /AutoDJ="classical" Dawn
/Exacttime /00:00
/RND,messagesFolder1,1
/Exacttime /01:00
/RND,messagesFolder2,1
/Exacttime /03:00
/RND,messagesFolder3,1
```

**Example 2** — Live with fixed-time jingle:

```
/Block /19:00-20:00 /Live
/Exacttime EXAMPLE /19:30
; Comments can be added in ExactTime like this
Memories in Time
Title-1
Title-2
```

The block continues normally until 19:30. At that time, the operator must press Play to execute the ExactTime; then the block continues

**Example 3** — AutoDj with weather break:

```
/Block /08:30-12:30 /AutoDj="Jazz Music"
/Exacttime /10:00 SF3
/Time
/Temp
/Hum
```

At 10:00 time/temperature/humidity are broadcast and then AutoDj resumes.

**Example 4** — Traffic report with chained events and MetaNames:

```
/Block /07:00-12:00 /Live
/Exacttime /07:45 ; TRAFFIC REPORT
@Traffic Opening
@traffic`<dd><mm><aaaa>`
@Traffic Closing
```

Each day it looks for trafficDDMMYYYY. If it doesn't exist, opening/closing don't play either as they're chained with @.

### **Sponsors "overlapping" music within ExactTime**

Besides inserting them as items, AUDICOM allows combining a music track with a sponsor that "overlaps" its introduction.

Syntax:

`"Title"/SS/KK`

- "Title": sponsor file.
- /SS: seconds from track start until sponsor insertion.
- /KK: mix ratio (10, 25, 50 or 100).

If you omit `/SS/KK`, the sponsor plays from track start respecting the level defined by the MIX control.

**Example:** Satellite with sponsor "overlapping" music

```
/Block /18:00-20:00 /Satslave
/Exacttime /18:45 EC
Title-1
+"Memories in Time"/05/25 
```

"Title-1" plays and, 5 s later, the sponsor enters with 25% mix

---

### Blocks with Sponsors

The `/Sponsor` command allows associating audio files (sponsors, jingles, beds, etc.) to the beginning, development, or end of a programming block.\
It must always be placed **after** the block command line.

**General syntax:**
`/Sponsor [SponsorName] +Open="Title"/SS/KK +Mid="Title"/SS/KK +Close="Title"/SS/KK`

#### Main Parameters

- **\+Open="Title"**\
  File played at block start (for example, a program introduction).
- **\+Mid="Title"**\
  File played after each break in the block (e.g., "continuing with our program…").
- **\+Close="Title"**\
  File played at block end (program closing).

#### Symbols (+ and \*)

- In **AutoDj** blocks:
  - `+` → Sponsor file overlaps ("rides over") the playing music.
  - `*` → Sponsor plays and then music continues, without overlap.
- In **Live**, **SatFill** and **SatSlave** blocks:\
  No difference between `+` and `*`; both are interpreted as `*`.

#### Optional Parameters

- `/SS`: time in seconds from music track start until Sponsor enters.
- `/KK`: relative mix level between Sponsor and music. Possible values: `10`, `25`, `50`, `100`.

If `/SS/KK` are not specified, Sponsor starts at track beginning and mix respects the level configured in the **MIX** control.

---

#### Examples

**Example 1 — Live block with sponsors at opening, break and closing**

/Block /22:00-24:00 /Live
/Sponsor EXAMPLE \*Open="Title-1" \*Mid="Title-2" \*Close="Title-3"

- At block start (22:00) **Title-1** plays.
- After each break within the block **Title-2** plays.
- As closing, at block end, **Title-3** plays.

---

**Example 2 — AutoDj block with sponsors and controlled mixing**

/Block /03:00-07:00 /AutoDj="Classical" Timeless Music
/Sponsor JINGLES \*Open="Title-1" +Mid="Title-2"/03/50 \*Close="Title-3"

- **Title-1** opens the block, followed by AutoDj music.
- At each break, a music track plays and, **3 seconds** later, **Title-2** enters, overlapped with the track at a **50%** mix ratio.
- At the end of the last track in the block, **Title-3** plays as closing.

---

<Note>
  In AutoDj blocks, the closing Sponsor (`Close`) executes at the beginning of the **last track in the block**.\
  In **Live** and **Satellite** blocks, the closing occurs **after the last break**.
