## Moving and Copying Files

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open second window">
    Enable **expanded mode** (red arrow) to have two panels.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select files">
    - Multiple selection with **Ctrl + click** (one by one).
    - Continuous range with **Shift + click** (from first to last).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose destination">
    In the secondary window, open the **destination folder**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Move">
    Drag the selection to the destination folder.\
    If the files were **registered in the Database**, their **location is automatically updated**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy">
    Drag while **holding Ctrl**: you'll see a **(+) sign** indicating copy.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  **autoDB Folders**

  - When moving/copying music to an **autoDB** folder:\
    a) If the file **was not** registered, it is **automatically added**.\
    b) If it **was already** registered, all info is kept **except "Style"**, which takes the **new folder name**.
  - From **autoDB → non-autoDB** folder: Database **remains unchanged**.
  - The **autoDB** logic applies **only during move/copy**; it doesn't modify information afterward.
</Info>

<Warning>
  Avoid moving/renaming/deleting registered files **using Windows tools**:

  - If moved, location will be corrected when aired (AutoDJ/InfoMusic), but requires **exhaustive searches**.
  - If deleted or renamed, Database will mark the media as **\_missing**.
</Warning>
