## AutoDJ Parameters

The **AutoDj Editor** module allows configuring a series of parameters that determine how musical tracks and additional elements are selected within an automated block. These parameters enable detailed control over styles, performers, authors, genres, tempo, mode, and also the insertion of elements like **promos, presentations or Meteor commands**. The main parameters are described below:

---

### Styles

Defines the musical styles that AutoDj will use within a format.

- A format can include **one style, several or all available styles**.
- Styles are **automatically rotated**, without predominance of one over another, except when a style has few available titles (in which case, it will appear less frequently).
- AutoDj will **NEVER select** a title that belongs to a style not included in this field.
- The order in the window does not influence the on-air output, except when **Induced Mode** is activated.

In **Induced Mode**, the programmer can establish how many titles should be played for each style in a sequence.\
For example: _Instrumental-Instrumental-Jazz-Jazz-Jazz-Blues_ → AutoDj will schedule two instrumental titles, three jazz titles and one blues title, restarting the sequence when finished.

The list can be manually reordered using Drag & Drop.

---

### Performers

Defines the performers to include in the programming.

- The **"Repeat every"** option prevents two titles from the same performer from being played consecutively.
- The configured number indicates how many titles from **different performers** must appear between two titles from the same performer.
- This value acts as a flexible rule: AutoDj will try to comply with it, although it may not always be possible with very limited databases.

---

### Authors

Allows restricting title selection according to specified **authors**.\
The system will only choose titles whose author matches those defined in the format.

---

### Include Top Hits

Allows titles marked as **Top Hit** to be played with a defined periodicity.

Example: If **Top 40 every 1 hour** is selected, AutoDj will try to insert a title marked as Top 40 approximately every 60 minutes of programming.

---

### Genders

Allows setting repetition restrictions according to **gender** (solo, duo, orchestra, etc.).

- A minimum number of titles from **different genders** that must play between two titles of the same gender is defined.
- This prevents, for example, several solo tracks from being played consecutively.

---

### Tempo / Mode

The **Tempo** (speed) and **Mode** (sonority) matrices allow configuring compatibilities between consecutive titles.

- You can indicate that two tracks with certain tempo or mode combinations should **not follow** each other.
- Example: if in the _Soft_ row the _Very Strong_ column is marked, AutoDj will avoid scheduling a _Very Strong_ track after a _Soft_ one.

> **Prediction rule:**\
> For the **first title of a block**, since there is no previous track, any title can be chosen, unless its entire row is blocked in the matrix. In that case, it will lose priority.

**Important notes:**

- If a title has no tempo/mode defined in the database, it is considered valid with any other.
- These rules have **low priority** compared to Style or Performer rules.
- Effectiveness depends on the number of available titles: the larger the database, the more efficient the matrix application.

Practical example:

- If you want **strong or very strong tracks not to play**, you must mark both the **columns** and **rows** corresponding to those values, ensuring they never appear either at the start or in continuity.

---

### Promos

Allows AutoDj to insert radio **promos** between musical tracks.

- The **Every Titles** option defines how many tracks should play between promos.
- The **Promos** field allows filtering by a prefix in the name.\
  Example: If `Promo=Summer` and `Every Titles=3`, AutoDj will insert a promo whose title begins with "Summer" every three songs (if they exist in the database).

**Using categories in InfoMusic:**

- **PROMOS:** valid for any time of day. Also used for time adjustments.
- **PROMOPGM:** specific to certain programs. Only inserted when running a format that includes them.
- **Separators:** not automatically inserted, remain outside AutoDj control.

<Note>
  In the `Autodj.ini` file, the line `promoPgmClass=PromoPgm` can be modified so AutoDj uses the **Promo** category instead of **PromoPgm** for periodic insertion.
</Note>

---

### Partners

Enables the use of **associated files (Partners)** that contain **previous presentations** for each track.

- If enabled, each song will play with its associated presentation.
- If disabled, titles are played without presentations, even if the files exist in the system.

---

### Insert Meteor

Allows automatically inserting **Meteor** commands (time, temperature, humidity, etc.) every certain number of titles.

- The **VOICE** option defines the voice to be used:
  - `1 = Male`
  - `2 = Female`
  - `3 = Extra`

This way, AutoDj can automatically integrate weather information between music, maintaining program continuity.
