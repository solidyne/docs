## Introduction

**ADMICOM** is the **Traffic and Billing** module of AUDICOM.\
Its main function is to manage the **commercial database**, independently from the audiovisual content database.

Key features include:

- Management of **client and agency contracts**.
- Distribution of **advertising blocks** within the programming schedule.
- Automatic generation of **daily commercial logs**, fully integrated with **CyberPlay**.
- Aired spots audit, with client reports and customizable spreadsheets compatible with external billing systems.
- Support for **centralized management of multiple stations**, allowing a single sales department to manage an entire radio network.

For stations with lower advertising volume, **AUDICOM Black** includes simplified tools that allow manual management of commercial logs by scheduling spots directly in the playlists.
