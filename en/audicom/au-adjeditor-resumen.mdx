### Overview

Creating automated music scheduling with AUDICOM is a simple process, based on defining automatic blocks (**AutoDj**) with a pre-established **format**. These blocks are scheduled from **CyberPlay Editor** and aired by the **AutoDj** engine, an **advanced music selection system** that works with the music database and format style sheets.

<Tip>
  The [**manual scheduling**](/es/audicom/au-cpeditor-comandosmusica) chapter explains how to schedule AutoDj blocks.

### Module Function

The **AutoDj Editor** allows you to **create and edit music FORMATS** that will be used by the AutoDj engine.\
Each format contains the **selection parameters** that AUDICOM uses to choose tracks: style, genre, artist, among others.

When an AutoDj block is active, the system:

- **Automatically generates the schedule** following the established format.
- **Reviews available tracks** in the database.
- **Assigns a score** to each track based on how well it matches the defined parameters.

---

### Selection Logic

- The review order starts with tracks that have **gone the longest without being aired**.
- Each track receives a **score between 0 and 100**.
- If a track scores above **90 points**, it is directly inserted into the **CyberPlay** schedule.
- This value of 90 is the **AutoDj tolerance** and can be adjusted in the `AUTODJ.INI` file by modifying the **Tolerance** variable.
- If no track reaches the minimum required score, the one with the **best relative rating** is selected.

### Scoring Example

Each parameter has a **different weight** in the scoring:

- A track's **Style** can award more points than its **Mode**, as it is considered more relevant for maintaining musical programming coherence.

This way, AutoDj ensures that scheduled music follows criteria defined by the station, respecting both **time rotation** and **stylistic characteristics** that should be emphasized in the programming.
