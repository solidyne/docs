Each operator has a **username** and **password** that determine their system permissions.\
User and permission management is exclusively handled through the **Access Levels** module (`security.exe`), accessible at:

`Start Menu > Programs > AUDICOM > Access Levels`

---

## Creating User Profiles

### Administrator

- The first user to configure is always the **Administrator**.
- Initial login:
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: _(empty)_
- After logging in, set a password using the **Password** button.
  - Store it securely: if lost, you must contact **Solidyne technical support** (`info@solidynePro.com`).
- Any user can become administrator by enabling the **User is administrator** option.
- Administrators can:
  - Access the **Access Levels** module.
  - Modify all users' permissions.
  - Have no operational restrictions.

### New Users

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add user">
    Press **Add** and enter the new username.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign password">
    Press **Password** to set the password.\
    Recommendation: let users set their own passwords to avoid forgetting Administrator-imposed passwords.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure permissions">
    Adjust the user's permissions and attributes according to their role.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Press **Save** to register the changes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delete">
    To delete a user, select them and press **Delete**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  If a user forgets their password, they must be deleted and created again.
</Note>

## Security Options

### Security Server

- The Security Database stores **passwords and profiles** in an encrypted file.
- All terminals must access this file (typically located on the **Server**).

### Network Failures

- When logging in, a local copy of the user profile is created.
- If the Server is unavailable, AUDICOM will use this local copy.
- In this condition, **desktop changes are not saved**.
