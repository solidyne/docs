## Introduction

<Note>
  The **File Manager** module was discontinued since **AUDICOM 14 (Audicom Black)** and replaced by **Media Manager**.\
  Although it remains included in the distribution to avoid an abrupt change, we recommend migrating to **Media Manager**, as File Manager will be removed in future versions.
</Note>

It can be accessed from the **"+ tools"** menu in the top bar of the main desktop.\
The module is organized in tabs that show the available audio files on each terminal (local or network drives).

**Features:**

- Uses a **fixed folder structure** (external folders will be ignored).
- Files are classified by type (Music, Spots, Commercials, Effects, etc.).
- Titles can be:
  - played on air,
  - inserted into the program schedule,
  - or loaded into Live Assist instant access buttons.

<Note>
  Each terminal only displays the folders declared on that terminal (**audioDrives**).\
  Additionally, the Administrator can restrict each user's access to specific folders from **Access Levels**.
</Note>

## General Description

The main window shows the files in the selected folder with the following fields:\
**Artist – Title – Duration – Format – Location**.

- To view other folders: click on the upper tabs.
- If there are more than 18 folders: use the scroll buttons `<-- -->`.
- Window size and position are configurable.
- Column order can be changed by clicking on the header.
- **Quick letter search** is also possible:
  - Example: Pressing "A" positions the cursor on the first file beginning with "A" in the active column.

## Title Colors (last air time)

Music files registered in the database appear in different colors according to time since last broadcast:

- **Red**: \< 4 hours
- **Orange**: 4-12 hours
- **Green**: 12-24 hours
- **Black**: \> 24 hours

Time ranges are configured in the **Configuration Panel**.

## Folder Colors

Each folder can be assigned a color for easier identification.

- Filters allow showing only folders of a specific color.
- Colors are unique and valid for all network terminals.
- They are defined when creating the folder or from the **INFO** window.

<Tip>
  We recommend creating a reference chart visible in the studio.\
  Example: red = music, green = spots, yellow = effects.
</Tip>

## Main Buttons

### Update

`[Numeric Keypad /]`

- Updates the selected folder to show new files.
- By default, File Manager stores the listing in memory when opening a folder; changes don't appear until pressing **Update**.
- The window shows date and time of last update.

### Insert

`[Enter]`

- Inserts the selected title into the **CyberPlay** window (above the yellow cursor).
- Also supports **Drag & Drop**.
- Multiple selected titles can be inserted at once.

### Cue Start / Stop

`[Delete]`

- Plays the selected title in **preview**.
- Double click = preview playback.
- Second click or Delete = play last 5 seconds (Cue End).
- Right click = stop preview.

<Warning>
  If the system works with **a single sound card**, there is no monitoring channel.\
  In this case, double clicking plays the file directly **on air**.
</Warning>

### Play

- Plays the selected title through the **Program** output (same as CyberPlay).
- If CyberPlay is already playing, the file mixes on air.
- Includes VU meters, time counter and position bar.

### Stop / Pause

- **Once**: stops and pauses (can resume).
- **Double click**: stops completely and moves to next file.

### Audio Edit

- Accessed from context menu or expanded window.
- Opens the file in the associated editor according to extension (.wav, .mp3, .txt).
- By default, .wav files open in **FX5**.
- If another editor is installed, Windows may automatically assign it.

### Syncro

Allows **folder synchronization** between two locations (left/right).

Options:

- **Sync left**: copies from right → left.
- **Sync right**: copies from left → right.
- **Both**: both folders end up with identical content.

<Info>
  Although File Manager remains functional, we recommend gradually migrating to **Media Manager**, which replaces all these functions with a more modern and scalable design.
