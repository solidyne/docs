## Introduction

AUDICOM offers different ways to **schedule news** for automatic broadcast, whether generated at the radio station or received remotely via **email** or **telephone**. There are two main modes: **scheduled news** and **instant news**.

### Scheduled News

Scheduled news is divided into two categories:

- **Certain occurrence**\
  These are items whose existence is confirmed and are directly included in the schedule.\
  Example: `/METEOR` commands (time, temperature, etc.).\
  In this case, it is recommended to define them directly in the radio schedule (`.PGM`) or through an **ExactTime Special Inclusion**.
- **Uncertain occurrence**\
  News that should be broadcast at a defined time, but whose arrival is not guaranteed.\
  These are implemented through **chained items** within an ExactTime Special Inclusion.\
  These allow defining up to **4 consecutive files** (opening, promo, news and closing).
  - The sequence is **only broadcast** if all files exist.
  - If one is missing, the entire sequence is canceled.
  - The news file uses a **metaname** that changes each day, ensuring its validity only for that date.

For more details, see: **"Special Inclusion" in "Schedule Content → Manual Programming → Create content blocks"**.

Scheduled news can come from:

- **AUDICOM WebTools** (mail-link).
- **Voice Mailing Software** (telephone).

### Instant News

Designed for radio stations broadcasting in **automatic programming** (`AutoDJ`, `i-Link`, satellite), without needing to manually change the schedule.

- The **NEWS** system is a background application that periodically checks for incoming news.
- If news arrives (via email or telephone, depending on implementation), the system broadcasts it and then returns to regular programming.

## News Suite

The **News Suite** module is designed for **live** operation.

- Allows working with **text files** associated with **audio files**.
- Can insert news into the **On-Air Screen**, either as **text only** or **text + audio**.
- In networks, multiple journalists can write their news on different terminals and send them to the news chief, who organizes and forwards them to the operator's terminal.
- The operator associates each text with corresponding **audio files** for broadcast.

We access the **News Suite** module from the **"+"** menu in the **toolbar**.\
It is a **text editor** designed for writing **news** and **journalistic reports**.

- Works with standard **TXT** format files.
- Its operation is similar to other basic processors (e.g.: Windows Notepad).
- Allows working with **multiple files open simultaneously**.

The **green line** that appears on the right indicates the **width to which the text will be adjusted** in the **comments window** of the On-Air Screen and in the **WebTools** interface.\
To view the text as the announcer will see it, manually adjust the window to the green line.

**Reading Time Estimation**

News Suite includes a tool that **estimates reading time** for a text.

- The calculation is based on a **reading speed** variable expressed in **characters per second (c.p.s.)**.
- The default value is **15 c.p.s.** (average value).
- Can be modified from the menu: **Edit \> Set Speed**.

To know the estimated duration of a text:

- Click the **clock icon** or press **F9**.
- A box will appear showing:
  - Total word count.
  - Total character count.
  - Estimated reading time (minutes and seconds).

### Text Files with Associated Audio

Each text file can be associated with one or two **audio files**.

**Procedure:**

1. Write and save the text file.
2. Open the **File Manager** and expand the second window (red arrow in the lower right corner).
3. Display **text files** in one window and **audio files** to associate in the other.
4. Select the text file and drag the audio file to it.

The text file will be renamed as follows:

**Audio File Association Rules**

- If the text file is named "news.txt" and the audio file is "audio.mp3", the text file will be renamed to "news.mp3.txt".
- If a second audio file is associated, it will be added to the name: "news.mp3.wav.txt".

<Note>
  The text file name will show the audio file extensions in the order they were associated.
</Note>

When a text file has associated audio:

- A speaker icon appears next to the file name.
- The audio file can be played from the text editor using **F7** or the **Play** button.
- The audio file can be played from the **On-Air Screen** using **F7**.

### Printing

To print a text file:

1. Open the file to print.
2. Go to **File > Print** or press **Ctrl + P**.
3. Select printing options:
   - Font type and size
   - Line spacing
   - Margins
   - Header and footer
   - Page numbers

<Note>
  The print preview shows exactly how the text will be printed.
</Note>

### Backup

News Suite automatically creates backup copies of text files:

- Backups are stored in the **Backup** folder inside the News Suite directory.
- Each time a file is saved, a backup copy is created.
- Backup files have the extension ".bak".
- The backup folder is automatically cleaned every 30 days.

To restore a backup file:

1. Go to the Backup folder.
2. Copy the desired .bak file.
3. Paste it in the News folder.
4. Remove the .bak extension.

<Warning>
  It is recommended to keep additional backups of important files on external storage devices.
