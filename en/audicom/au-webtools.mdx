The **WebTools services panel** allows viewing real-time information about the on-air playlist through a web browser.\
An announcer can see the **countdown** of the currently playing title or upcoming titles by simply switching browser tabs.

In addition to monitoring, **WebTools** includes:

- **File transfer**
- **Weather updates** 
- **RSS news panel**

> It can be accessed from any device with Internet access, without needing to connect to the station's LAN.

<Note>
  WebTools services require Internet access on the On-Air terminal.
</Note>

## WebTools Client

On the On-Air terminal, **WebTools Client** sends playback information to the WebTools server.\
It launches with AUDICOM and keeps updated:

- **Weather data**
- **Dynamic RSS news** (exported to text files for use by other AUDICOM modules)

The service appears **minimized** in the Windows taskbar.\
Right-click to access the interface.

### Weather Data (Meteor)

1. Click **Config** to open the configuration panel.
2. Enter the station's **geographical coordinates**.
   - You can get them by clicking on the map.
   - For more precision, use **Google Maps** (right-click on a point → copy coordinates).

Once coordinates are loaded, data updates automatically when Internet is available.

---

## WebTools Screens

Access through a browser by entering:\
`http://www.audicom.us/Panel`

During AUDICOM installation, the **AStart** wizard requests:

- Station name
- Username and password

This creates the **WebTools account** and sends a confirmation email.

> Don't lose that email, it contains the access credentials.

---

## Live Panel

The **Live Panel** is WebTools' main environment.\
Different tools can be accessed from a menu in the lower left corner. Windows can be moved and resized.

### CyberPlay

Shows real-time information from the On-Air terminal:

- **Current title**
- **History** of played titles
- **Upcoming** titles

Includes content from:

- Main playlist (CyberPlay)
- Auxiliary playlists (Playlist Manager 1 and 2)
- Quick access pads (Live Assist 1 and 2)

### Weather

Shows weather data for configured cities.

- To add a city:\
  `Live Panel -> Add weather` → Enter city → Search → Save.

The new window appears in the Panel.

### RSS Content

Allows adding dynamic news sources.\
Steps:

1. Copy the **RSS URL** from the site (example: RSS icon on **Telesur**).
2. In WebTools: `Home -> Live Panel -> Add RSS` → paste URL.
3. Assign a **short name** to identify the source.

RSS windows update every **10 minutes**, with visible countdown.\
The **"More time"** button extends the update interval (useful for announcers while reading).

### Live Read Ads

- Live read ads appear in popup windows with the **text to read**.
- The announcer closes the window after reading → this records:
  - **Reading time**
  - **Program audio snippet**

This way, AUDICOM performs **dynamic control** over live reads.

### Whiteboard

Works as an **internal chat**, visible to all connected users.

### Removing Elements

From `Home -> Configuration`, you can remove panel elements.\
The icon on the right of each window allows removal.

### File Manager

Allows **file transfer** of audio to the station from anywhere with Internet access (example: an interview recorded at a bar or airport).

<Note>
  To enable the web file manager from outside the station:

  - Forward **ports 777 to 780** to the On-Air PC's LAN IP.
  - Assign **static IP** to the On-Air PC (DHCP disabled).
  - Static IP must be below the router's DHCP server range.
</Note>

## Mail-Link and Remote News

This feature allows users to send **emails with attachments** (MP3 audio or TXT text) directly to computers running AUDICOM.\
The destination address is:

`stationName@audicom.us`

This way, a journalist can record an interview on their mobile phone and email it to the station.

- Attached files are automatically copied to a system folder.
- The system sends a **confirmation email** to the sender when the file transfers to the audio server.
- Optionally:
  - The **email subject** can indicate the destination folder.
  - The email body can contain a **security keyword** to restrict unauthorized submissions.

These reports can be automatically scheduled with **BotNews**, which adds intros and outros, or even generate AI voiceovers when reports arrive in text format.

---

## Mail-Link Email Address

The address is formed with the station's **alias**, defined in the **AStart** wizard, followed by `@audicom.us`.

Example:\
Alias: `demoFM` → Mail-Link address: `demoFM@audicom.us`

If not created, run **AStart** from:\
`Start -> AUDICOM -> AStart`\
or directly:\
`C:\Audicom\Astart.exe`

Sending can be done from **PC, notebook or smartphone**, without special configuration.

---

## Files and Folders

- The email must contain **a single MP3 file**.
- AUDICOM Web Tools receives the email and copies the file to an audio folder.

If the **subject** includes an existing folder name (e.g.: `REPORTS`), the file is copied there.\
If it doesn't match any folder, it's stored in the default: `eMail`.

---

## How to Schedule Submissions

For AUDICOM to process emails, **Web Tools** must be running at the station.

### Schedule at Specific Times

**Special Inclusions (ExactTime)** are used:

`/Block /07:00-12:00 /Live`\
`/Exacttime /007:45`\
`; TRAFFIC REPORT`\
`@Traffic Opening`\
`@traffic-<dd><mm><yyyy>`\
`@Traffic CLOSING`

Example: The traffic report `traffic-14032013.mp3` airs at **07:45**.\
The next day, if no new file exists with current date, the block automatically cancels.

For multiple daily submissions, add the **time** to the filename:

`/Block /07:00-12:00 /Live`\
`/Exacttime /07:30`\
`@traffic730-<dd><mm><yyyy>`\
`/Exacttime /08:30`\
`@traffic830-<dd><mm><yyyy>`\
`/Exacttime /09:30`\
`@traffic930-<dd><mm><yyyy>`\
`/Exacttime /10:30`\
`@traffic1030-<dd><mm><yyyy>`

---

### Immediate Playback with NEWS

The **NEWS** module monitors a folder.\
When it detects a new file:

- Waits for the current title to end.
- Interrupts automated programming.
- Inserts the received audio, with optional opening/closing.

It's recommended to configure NEWS to use the `eMail` folder or create a specific one.

---

## FTP Client

**WebTools** includes an **FTP server** for file transfers.

Requirements:

1. Username/password created in AUDICOM (**Access Levels**).
2. User must have write/rename permissions.

**Local access parameters:**\
`FTP IP: 192.168.100.253`\
`FTP User: AUDICOMuser`\
`FTP Pass: AUDICOMuser`\
