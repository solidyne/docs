## Database / dbReindex

Although AUDICOM's Database is reliable, failures can occur (e.g., power outages or PC errors) that may affect its integrity. If you detect anomalies in **AutoDJ** or **InfoMusic**, the Database might be corrupted.

To repair it:

1. Close all applications using the Database (Air, InfoMusic, AutoDJ Editor, File Manager).
2. Run `dbReindex.exe` from the `\Audicom` folder.

**Available Options:**

- **Reindex Database:** Rebuilds indexes. Requires running the _Compact_ option first.
- **Compact Database:** Removes deleted records (e.g., titles deleted in InfoMusic) and optimizes the database. Using this option is always recommended.
- **Verify File Existence:** Checks if titles have associated files. Missing files are marked as `_missing`.
- **Revalidate Lost Files:** Recovers titles marked as `_missing` if files become available again (useful for removable drives).
- **Delete Lost Titles:** Permanently removes titles marked as `_missing`.
- **Clean Title Field:** Converts title names to _sentence_ mode (first letter capitalized).
- **Clean Fields:** Normalizes uppercase/lowercase in Author, Performer, Genre, and Style. Empty fields are marked as _UNCLASSIFIED_.
- **Adjust Drive Mapping:** Fixes disk references when Windows changes drive letter assignments.
- **`Rename files to <performer - title>:`** Physically renames files according to Database information. **Cannot be undone.**
- **Reset Last Play Date:** Assigns current date and time to all titles, affecting their playback order.
- **Assign Codes to Each Title:** Adds unique codes to titles, required for synchronizing with external systems (e.g., PowerGold).
- **Create System Information for Support:** Generates a report (`C:\soporte.txt`) and attaches it to the default email for sending to technical support.
- **Sync File Info with DB:** Writes Database information into audio/video file metadata.

**Action Buttons:**

- **Procced:** Starts the selected process.
- **Quit:** Closes the application.

### Self-Diagnostic System

AUDICOM includes a mechanism that checks Database status when improperly closed. If errors are detected, it attempts automatic repairs.

This system can be enabled or disabled by modifying the `Audicom.ini` file:

```
[Settings]
Autoreindex=1
```

`1` = Self-diagnostic active.

`0` = Self-diagnostic inactive.

### Information Backup

To ensure security, perform periodic backups of the following directories and files:

- `\Audicom\DB` → Music database, users (`user.ini`) and content (`data.sqlite`).
- `\Audicom\Log\*.log` → Commercial logs.
- `\Audicom\Pgm\*.pgm` → Programs and blocks organization.
- `\Audicom\Air\*.air` → Broadcast logs (optional, if historical records are desired).
- `\Admicom` → Administrative database.

<Warning>
  The system does **NOT perform automatic backups**. It is the network administrator's or technical manager's responsibility to perform and maintain backups.
</Warning>

Update installers do **not overwrite** these files, so they can be executed safely.

## Technical Support

- Updates are free for one year from purchase. They include all changes within the same product line (**AUDICOM** and **AUDICOM BLACK**).
- After this period, the license can be renewed by contacting Solidyne or an authorized distributor. Renewal includes one year of **WebTools services**.
- The license expiration date is shown in the **I-Logon** startup module and the AUDICOM Toolbar.

In case of problems:

1. First check the information in the help and FAQ.
2. If insufficient, contact Solidyne support by email or phone.
3. You can request remote support: technicians access the AUDICOM network to review settings and detect problems.

<Note>
  This remote service has additional cost, but saves time and prevents interruptions in station operation.
