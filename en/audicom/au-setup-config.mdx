## aConfig Panel

This tool **launches during installation**. The **aStart** Configuration Panel defines audio output assignments and other system settings.\
Options are grouped by categories.

<Warning>
  To save changes, always use **Save changes** or **Save and exit**.\
  Configuration must be done on each terminal.
</Warning>

The panel can also **be opened after installation** from the program group created in the Windows Start menu.

### Audio

- Determines the use of each channel.
- The **CyberPlay**, **Live Assist 1**, **Live Assist 2** and **Playlist Manager 1 and 2** modules can be assigned to different output channels.
- A dedicated channel can be defined for preview monitoring (CUE).

<Note>
  Channels assigned in mix mode are added to the main program output.\
  When changing assignments, all AUDICOM applications must be restarted.
</Note>

### Folders

#### Audio Sources

![A Config Fuentesde Audio Jp](/images/audicom/aConfig_FuentesdeAudio.jpg)

- **Servers**: Defines enabled disk drives for each terminal.
  - Must be declared in **UNC** mode, for example: `\\Server` or `\\PC-AIRE`.

<Warning>
  Even in installations without a dedicated server, it is essential to define files using **UNC network paths**. If configured as drive `C`, other terminals will not be able to access the on-air computer contents.
</Warning>

- **Partners Location (voiceovers)**: Folder for pre-recorded song presentations (dry voices).
- **Replacement Promos Location**: Folder with content that replaces promos and station IDs from remote-linked programs via iLink.

#### Databases

![A Config Basede Datos Jp](/images/audicom/aConfig_BasedeDatos.jpg)

- **MAM Database (Media Asset Management)**: Single location of the music database.
  - Can be hosted on the server (`\\SERVER\Audicom\db`) or on the on-air computer (`\\AIRE\Audicom\db`).
- **Programming (PGM)**: `.pgm` files that define non-commercial content.
- **Commercial (LOG)**: `.log` files that define commercial scheduling.
- **Air Log**: On-air broadcast records.
- **Music Formats**: Database for AutoDJ.
  - Usually hosted on the on-air terminal.
  - In multiple stations, each station maintains its own formats (e.g.: `\\Station-1\Audicom`, `\\Station-2\Audicom`).
  - Any Audicom terminal or **AutoDJ Editor** can access different on-air terminals.

<Note>
  **Advanced music database customization**

  It's important to note that some database aspects can be modified **BEFORE** starting to load audio files into the system. By editing the audicom.ini configuration file, it's possible to redefine some database fields such as CATEGORY, TEMPO, MODE definitions, among others.
