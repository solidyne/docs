AUDICOM handles not only commercial breaks and music blocks: it allows defining practically **all on-air events**.

The main block types that determine programming are:

### Live Program (LIVE)

AUDICOM generates **stop points** between commercial breaks (or optionally, **empty spaces** without pause).\
The system **remains stopped** during live content; the operator can play music and material between breaks.\
**Counters** alert when the **next break** approaches.

### Automatic Music Program (AutoDJ)

The computer plays **music between breaks**.\
Selection is done **track by track**, in **real time**, using **AutoDJ Formats** and the **InfoMusic** Database.\
It can also work with **predetermined playlists**, either custom or generated by third parties (Power Gold, Selector).

### Satellite Programs

The computer inserts **local spots** and then enables the **satellite program**.\
The audio console is **controlled** by AUDICOM.\
Two modes are available:

- **Time-based switching** (_SatFill_).
- **Trigger signal switching** (satellite slaves).

### Streaming Links and Repeaters

Similar to satellite blocks, but the source is a **streaming flow** (web server) or an **iLink connection** from an AUDICOM head-end.

### Special Inclusions (ExactTime) and Direct Programming

Allow **forcing events at exact times** (song of the week, micro, news, sponsorship, promo, /Time, etc.) **within** a block.

<Info>
  All these types and features are detailed in **Program Block Instructions** (same chapter).

## Magic Programming

Tool that **generates instructions** without typing commands. Inserts code at current cursor position.

**Usage Flow:**

1. **Select event type** to program:
   - **Live Programs**: AUDICOM only generates commercial blocks; operator adds music/imaging.
   - **AutoDJ Programs**: automatic music programming with an **AutoDJ Format** (see **AutoDJ Editor**).
   - **iLink Connection**: for Internet **repeaters**.
   - **Satellite Link**: switching by **time** (SatFill) or by **commands** (Slaves).
   - **ExactTime**: special inclusion at **exact time** (for example, "Song of the week").
   - **Direct track sequence**: creates a music list; see **Playlists**.
2. **Program name and schedule**\
   Define **Name**, **Start** and **End** of block, then continue.
3. **Sponsors / imaging breaks**\
   You can assign files to **Open**, **Mid**, **Close** (drag from **File Manager** or **InfoMusic**).\
   If **Sponsor Name** is empty, the entire section is **ignored**.
4. **AutoDJ Format**\
   If block is AutoDJ, select **Format** from menu.
5. **ExactTime Inclusion**\
   Allows **fixed-time insertion** of one or more titles (micro, news, sponsored songs, /Time, temperature, etc.).

**Example of generated instructions:**

```txt
/Block /20:00-22:00 /Live Consagrados
/Sponsor TITRAIJU +Open="Opening sponsorship" +Mid="Block start" +Close="Closing sponsorship"
```

## Direct Music Track Sequence

Creates **playlists (PlayList)** or inserts a **title list** within a block **in PGM** (at cursor point).\
Can also be called from **CyberPlay-Test** (right click on block header → insert sequence).

**Available Methods:**

- **TOP HIT Ranking**: based on TOP HIT field in DB.
- **Weekly play ranking**: sorts by number of plays in **last week** (most played first).
- **Subordinate AutoDJ**: generates list using specified **AutoDJ Format** (same logic as real-time, but **pre-listed**).
- **Random Music**: random selection without considering play dates.

**Target Duration**\
After choosing method, indicate **estimated duration** of PlayList and confirm.\
For **Subordinate AutoDJ**, musical **format** is also requested.

<Note>
  A PlayList can include **Comments** (`;`), **Pauses** (`/Pause`) and **Time** (`/Time`).\
  Pauses and /Time can also be inserted from **CyberPlay** (right click at desired position).
</Note>

---

## Playlists (PlayLists)

**PlayLists** are **.txt** files with a list of titles to broadcast. They are inserted in **CyberPlay** from **PlayList Manager**.

Basic syntax: **music track** names (one per line). Allowed:

- **Comments**: line starting with `;`
- **/Time**
- **/Pause**

### Creating a PlayList

**a) Manual Assembly (recommended with InfoMusic-Production)**

1. Press **New PGM** to clear PGM; close **Magic Programming** if not used.
2. From **InfoMusic-Production** or **File Manager**, drag titles to **PGM window**.
3. Press **TEST** to preview and validate PlayList (graphical view in **CyberPlay**).

**b) Automatic Assembly (wizard)**

1. Press **New PGM** → **Magic Programming** → **Direct track sequence**.
2. Choose **TOP HIT Ranking**, **Weekly play ranking**, **Subordinate AutoDJ** or **Random Music**.
3. Define target **duration**; for Subordinate AutoDJ, indicate **format**.
4. List is generated and shown in **TEST**.

<Note>
  PlayLists can include **Comments**, **Pauses** and **/Time**; /Pause and /Time also from **CyberPlay** with right click.
</Note>

### Preview and Modification

In **preview** (graphical) you can:

- View **duration** of each title and **complete PlayList**.
- Verify **file existence**: if missing, title appears in **RED** (common in old lists).
- **Reorder** titles by mouse dragging.
- Insert **/Pause** and **/Time** with right click.
- **Delete** titles (right click → delete).
- **Add** titles by dragging from **InfoMusic-Production** or **File Manager**.

**PlayList Example (text and view):**

```txt
;Manual Playlist
Artist A - Track 1
/Time
Artist B - Track 2
/Pause
Artist C - Track 3
```

<Warning>
  A file in **RED** will not be played (on-air will skip it) and continue with next one.
</Warning>

### Saving a PlayList

- In **Save PGM**, use **New PlayList** to name and save.
- Saves as **.txt** in **PGM** folder.
- **Show PlayLists only** option filters save view.

<Info>
  You can also create PlayLists **with a text editor** and save them in `\Audicom\PGM`. Then load them in **TEST-CYBERPLAY** to validate file existence.

## Direct Programming

Used to **program content** within a **LIVE block**.\
Titles or instructions placed **immediately below** block line are programmed in **order of appearance**.\
If time between breaks is **exceeded**, AUDICOM continues programming **after the break**, respecting **flexibilities**.

**Example:**

```txt
/Block /07:00-09:00 /Live
Front Line Assembly - Gun
Funker Vogt - Civil War
Leaether Strip - Kill a raver
Wumpscut - Womb
BlutEngel - My Time
Hocico - Coward as a slave
Aghast View - Truthhead
Solitary Experiment - Soldiers of Fortune
Decoded Feedback - Passion of flesh
Second Disease - Can't be me
```

<Info>
  Useful for long **pre-recorded programs / "canned" shows**.\
  If file is 45 min long, there must be **enough space** between breaks.\
  Break **flexibility** can shift a break to accommodate the block.
</Info>

<Tip>
  To compensate differences between **block duration** and **breaks**, consider using **AutoDJ blocks** (fill with music/promos).\
  In **LIVE**, if block is shorter than space, **pauses** may appear.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  If you try to program a **30 min** file and breaks are every **15 min**, file **cannot** be programmed (might even fall to end of day, depending on grid).
</Warning>

<Note>
  If filename **includes a period** within name (e.g.: `107.5.wav`) and is **not** registered in Database, it **must** be scheduled with extension.
</Note>
