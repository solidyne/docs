Aaudit is AUDICOM's **broadcast audit tool**. It allows querying, playing back and generating reports from the daily logs of what was aired on the On-Air terminal.

It can be accessed via the **Audit** button in the Applications Bar. By default it's available on the _Commercial_ desktop (User = comercial), though it can be added to any user desktop.

The logs are displayed graphically, similar to the **CyberPlay** window:

- Files played in a commercial break → green background
- Files played by AutoDJ or live blocks → light blue background with asterisk
- Program stop intervals (presumed live) → yellow background
- Even hours → light gray, odd hours → dark gray

Broadcast logs are saved on the On-Air terminal as files with `.air` extension, one for each broadcast day. The location is defined in `Audicom.ini` under `[Directories]`.

<Note>
  Double-clicking an `.air` file in Windows Explorer will open it directly in Aaudit.

### Music or spots identification

Aaudit determines the file type using two criteria:

1. **Playback block:** everything aired within a commercial break is marked as _commercial spot_.
   - Example: if the operator inserts a music track within a break, it will be marked as spot.
2. **Database:** the **Class** field in InfoMusic is validated.
   - `Class = Spot` → appears in green
   - `Class ≠ Spot` (Promo, Music) → appears in light blue
   - `Empty Class or unregistered file` → considered Spot if aired in a break

### User logging

The On-Air module also includes user changes in the logs.\
In Aaudit they appear as gray lines with red text, indicating login/logout time and username.

---

### Playing a title

You can listen to a logged file by selecting it and pressing **Play**.\
The file plays from its original location: if moved or deleted it cannot be played.

---

### Open file

The **.air** button allows opening another log.

- By default files from current month are shown
- The _File types_ menu allows expanding view to previous logs
- In installations with multiple on-air terminals, you can select which terminal to open logs from

---

### Save as TXT

Allows exporting the log in plain text, useful for viewing or printing in any text editor.

---

### Print

Generates a paper report similar to graphical reports, but sent directly to printer.

---

### Available reports

The reports menu includes different modes:

- **Global Report:** duration of selected file, number of broadcasts and total airtime
- **Spot tracking:** detailed list of broadcasts of a title within a date range, with playback times to verify complete airing
- **Copyright Listing:** report with Title, Artist, Author, record label and album code, for submission to entities like SADAIC

### Graphical reports

Aaudit can generate different visual graphs:

- **Pie Chart:** percentages of music, spots and live programs. Double click → minutes and seconds
- **24-Hour Composition:** bars showing hourly distribution of music, spots and programs. Double click on bar → exact times

<Warning>
  The `.air` files are usually stored in the `Audicom\Air` folder of the On-Air terminal.\
  Their names correspond to the date (`YYYYMMDD.air`). It's recommended to periodically delete very old logs to avoid unnecessary disk usage.
