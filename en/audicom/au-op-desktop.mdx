## Desktop Customization

The visibility, position and size of modules on the desktop can be configured individually for each user.

### Station or Media Name

- Double click on a free area of the bar opens a window to enter the station or media name.
- The name appears in the top right of the screen.
- This data is valid only for that terminal and is stored locally.
- The text in parentheses corresponds to the Windows computer name on the network.

### "+" Tools Button

- Shows the different AUDICOM tools organized by application area.
- The menu content can be edited to show only tools relevant to the user.
- If the user does not have permissions for on-air modules (CyberPlay, Live Assist, Playlist Manager, I-Rec), the bar hides those accesses and only enables the **+ Tools** menu.

## Time and Weather Data

This module automatically informs listeners of the exact time and weather data:

- Temperature
- Humidity
- Atmospheric pressure
- Rainfall

Data is updated in real-time via Internet.\
AUDICOM generates announcements using pre-recorded files with male and female voices.

### Display

Shows current date, time and data.

### Weather Data Update

- Automatic updates require Internet connection and active **AUDICOM WebTools** service.
- WebTools is an optional subscription that enables additional features and remote support (see configuration in _Audicom WebTools_).
- Without WebTools, data can be manually loaded with double click on the left area of the bar (Time/Meteor).

### Current Time

- Click on the Time/Meteor area opens the **METEOR** window, where time and weather announcements are configured.
- The displayed time corresponds to Windows time.

<Warning>
  If modifying Windows time, ensure AUDICOM is stopped.\
  Changing time during playback may cause errors in time calculations.
</Warning>

- **Top of hour beep**: if enabled, a beep sounds at the top of each hour.
  - The playback channel is defined in the Configuration Panel.

### Voices

Allows defining the voice combination to be used for time and weather announcements.

### Manual Announcement Playback

- Normally announcements are scheduled in programming.
- They can also be triggered manually from the **METEOR** window.
- If several are launched consecutively, they play in order.
- Audio is sent to the channel assigned to the **CyberPlay** module.
- If AUDICOM is playing other content, the announcement mixes with the on-air audio according to the level set by CyberPlay's **MIX** button.
