## Music Database

AUDICOM features a powerful music information system based on 14 key parameters. These fields feed the **AutoDJ** to generate automated programming with artistic criteria difficult to achieve in other systems.

The Database automatically records statistics like **play count**, **last played**, **peak rotation week**, etc. Other parameters—such as **Class** (Music, Promo, Spot, Fill), **Genre**, **Performer**, **Author**—can be manually entered or edited.

Files enter the Database in two ways:

- **Automatic**: by copying them to **autoDB folders** from **File Manager** (ready for AutoDJ according to folder style).
- **Manual**: using the **InfoMusic-Production** module (recommended for fine curation and cataloging).

The InfoMusic interface facilitates data entry because it **remembers** the values entered by users: each field keeps its history and becomes selectable from dropdown menus. The **more complete** each title's record is, the **better** the **AutoDJ** selection will work.

<Note>
  The **autoDB folders** in **File Manager** greatly reduce ingestion work. See the "File Manager" chapter for details and organizational best practices.
</Note>

## User Information Fields (description)

These are the operator-editable fields. Not all need to be completed, **except** `Class` and—for music—`Style`. However, leaving fields empty reduces the artistic quality of automatic selection. You can complete them progressively over time.

> Keyboard functions are shown in brackets where applicable.

### File (FileName)

Shows **name and path** of the audio file. To select, use **New (Browse)**, choose the folder and open the file. The **full name** (with path) will display here and the **filename** will also copy to the **Title** field.

- You can input **multiple files at once** with **File Manager** (drag & drop) or using **Scan**.
- If you want to **change the Title** under which the file will be registered, do it **before saving**: once added, you **cannot** modify the **Title** field in the database (to prevent duplicates). If there's an error, you must **delete the record** and **re-enter it** with the correct title.
- If you try to register a **file** with a **Title** that already exists, InfoMusic will notify and offer to **associate** that title with the current file (typical when different performers share a song name). If accepted, **all previous data** for that title will be **replaced** with the new data.

### Title

Title under which the file is registered in the Database. It is **mandatory**. Maximum **32 characters** (including spaces). **No two identical titles** can exist in the Database. When loading from **New**, the filename copies to the **Title** field.

- **Titles** can be **renamed** from **File Manager** with **F2 (Change Name)**: this keeps the filename and Database **synchronized**.
- If you try to register a file with an **existing title**, InfoMusic will alert you and you can choose to **associate** it with the current file (overwriting previous metadata).

<Note>
  For **numbered** listings above 9, **pad with zeros** to maintain order: `Title 01`, `Title 02` … `Title 20`.\
  Forbidden characters in titles: `/ * \ " | ? < > :`
</Note>

### Comments

Text that appears in the **comments window** of the On-Air Screen while the file plays. Useful for audience-valuable information. Maximum **254** characters.\
If the file comes from **HD-Corder** and includes comments, or if it's an **MP3 with ID3 v1/v2** with comments, it will load automatically.

### Style [ F7 ]

Defines the **musical style** of the title (e.g.: Classic, Melodic, Instrumental, Jazz, Pop, Rock & Roll, etc.). This is a **critical field** for proper **AutoDJ** selection.

- Carefully plan the **set of styles** to use. Avoid styles with **very few titles** (they complicate rotation).
- All styles are **saved once** and then selected from an alphabetical menu.

<Note>
  The **"Uncategorized"** style is created by **dbReindex** when it detects titles with **empty Style**.
</Note>

### Performer [ F10 ]

Name of the performer. Each new value is **memorized** and reusable from the dropdown menu.

### Author [ F9 ]

Name of the **composer** of the work.

### Position

**Informative** marker to indicate if a track works as an **Opening** or **Closing** (based on its musical character). Helps quick searches for the operator. **AutoDJ doesn't use this mark** for positioning by itself.

### Tempo

Execution speed. Four fixed values: **Largo**, **Andante**, **Allegro**, **Presto**.

### Mood

Intensity/loudness. Four fixed values: **Very Soft**, **Soft**, **Strong**, **Very Strong**.\
Allows adapting music to time slots (e.g., less "Very Strong" late at night, more freedom on weekends).

### Gender [ F8 ]

Classification by **formation**: Solo, Duo, Group, Orchestra, etc. You can create **subgenders** (e.g.: Female/Male Solo). AutoDJ can vary the sequence to provide **diversity** (e.g., alternate formations).

### Recording Company

Name of the **record label**. Low impact on musical logic, but **useful for reports** (e.g., SADAIC or local organizations) or label agreements.

### Top Hit [ F11 ]

Indicates if the track belongs to a **ranking**: `Top-100`, `Top-40`, `Top-25`, `Top-10` or empty.\
AutoDJ can schedule **periodic repetitions** of Top Hits (configurable in the format).

### Class

Defines the **content type**: `Music`, `Spots` (Ads), `Fills`, `Promos` (Promotional).

- **Music**: standard musical tracks.
- **Promos**: self-promotion pieces; also used for **fine time** adjustments.
- **Fills**: brief **voiceless** music for second-precise adjustments (e.g.: entering a commercial break or newscast at exact time).
- **Spots**: commercial ads.

### Using the Promo category

Two main labels: **PROMO** and **PROMOPGM**.

- **PROMO**: enabled for AutoDJ blocks and for **time compensation** in any format.
- **PROMOPGM**: **specific** program promotionals; **not** used for time adjustments.

Best practices:

1. **Program promos** (interspersed every "n" tracks in AutoDJ): `Class = PromoPgm`. Can be filtered by prefix (e.g.: `Afternoon-1`, `Afternoon-2`…) in the AutoDJ format.
2. **General 24/7 promos**: `Class = Promo`. Useful for **adjustments** (have **many** and of **various durations**).
3. **Special separators** that AutoDJ should **not** handle automatically: `Class = Separators` (manual scheduling).

<Note>
  In `Autodj.ini`, you can change the category AutoDJ uses when interspersing promos: `promoPgmClass=PromoPgm` (default).\
  If you want it to use `Promo` instead of `PromoPgm`, set `promoPgmClass=Promo`.
</Note>

### Processing

If you have a **562dsp** with **VirtualRack**, you can assign the processing **preset** by **title** (e.g., `20:Rock&POP`). When the track plays, AUDICOM requests VirtualRack to change to the indicated program.

- **VirtualRack** runs separately and must be **running** (**AUDICOM** mode) for switching to work.
- Creating a **shortcut** to **start with Windows** is recommended.
- Can run in **demo mode** without hardware for testing.

### Media

Indicates where the title is stored: **HD** (disk) or **other media** (CD, MD, DAT, etc.).

- **AutoDJ** operates only with **HD**.
- If the media is **not** HD, the **file** may **not** be associated (empty File Name field).
- If a title with external media is inserted On-Air, a **pause** is created for the operator to trigger it from the indicated medium.

If `Media = _missing`, the file **doesn't exist** on disk, was **moved** or **renamed** outside InfoMusic/File Manager.\
Use **dbReindex** (option "Verify files exist") to **mark** them as `_missing`. `_missing` titles are **not** inserted On-Air.

### Album ID / CD # / Track

- **CD Track**: track number when media is **CD** (or other physical media). If **0**, **CD-ROM** is assumed; if CD isn't in drive, title will be **ignored** and marked as **error**.
- **CD #**: disk identifier number (numbers only).
- **ExternalID / Album ID**: **external scheduler** ID (Selector, PowerGold) or **catalog code**. Alphanumeric, **up to 16 characters**.

### Fade In / Out

Defines **crossfade times** by **title**: entry (**Fade In**) and exit (**Fade Out**), in **tenths** of second (0 to 50 → 0 to 5 s).

- **Soft** endings: high values (10 to 50).
- **Abrupt** endings: shorter values (5 to 10).
- **Spots** (voice to voice): generally **0** to avoid overlaps; if they have background/effect, use **3 to 6**.
- In files **under 8 s**, cross-fades are **ignored**.

<Note>
  If entering InfoMusic from **HD Recorder**:

  - Files **\< 1 min** → cross-fade **0** and `Class = Spot`.
  - Files **≥ 1 min** → cross-fade **25** (2.5 s) and `Class = Music`.
</Note>

## Playback Controls and INTRO Time

<img
  src="/images/audicom/au-infomusic_produccion-reproduccion.png"
  alt="Au Infomusic Production Playback Pn"
  title="Au Infomusic Production Playback Pn"
  style={{ width:"58%" }}
/>

- **Play / Stop**: control playback of the **selected title**.
- **VU** (left) shows level and a **counter**.
- **Duration**: total file duration.

**Setting INTRO** (voice entry point):

1. Play the file and, **when voice enters**, press **SET INTRO**: the time is registered.
2. Use **PLAY INTRO** to play **from** intro and validate.
3. The **Intro** field is **editable**; you can fine-tune manually. A **position bar** is also available for precise movement.

On the **On-Air Screen**, the **Intro** appears as a **countdown** for the operator/announcer.\
In **automatic operation**, AutoDJ can **overlap presentations** at the track start adjusted to the **Intro** so the **singer enters** right after the announcement ends (professional "live" effect).

---

## Clearing Fields

You can **modify** any field at any time and **save**.\
E.g.: changing a track's **Style**: select the new value and **save** the record.

<Note>
  If you delete **all** titles of a Style/Author/etc., that item will remain visible in the menu **until InfoMusic is closed**. Upon reopening, the value will have disappeared.
</Note>

## Fixed Fields (read-only)

These are **automatic**; the user **cannot** edit them.

- **Length**: total in mm:ss. Can be **recalculated** with **dbReindex** (useful after audio editing).
- **Fs / Bitrate**: sampling frequency (WAV/PCM) or compression rate (kbps in MPEG).
- **Rec Mode**: **2S** (discrete stereo), **MO** (mono), **JS** (Joint Stereo).
- **Recording Date**: day/month/year.
- **Last Time on Air**: date and time of last broadcast.
