## Update / Reinstallation

To change the on-air computer or reinstall AUDICOM, follow this procedure:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install on the new computer">
    Install AUDICOM using the original installer.
    The new computer must have the **same network name** as the original computer.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Replace AUDICOM folder">
    Replace the `C:\AUDICOM` folder created by the installer on the new computer with the `C:\AUDICOM` folder from the current computer.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Replace ADMICOM folder">
    Replace the `C:\ADMICOM` folder created by the installer on the new computer with the `C:\ADMICOM` folder from the current computer.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Version update (optional)">
    If you want to update the AUDICOM version, you must have an **active support and updates contract**.
    The annual support service includes remote access by a specialized technician to update and configure the system.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Users can install updates by downloading them from [www.solidyne.ar](http://www.solidyne.ar).
To install an update, select the **"Modular - Reinstall"** option:
- Installs the same programs as the generic mode but allows choosing individual modules from a menu.
- Updates are usually distributed as a single executable file downloadable from the web.

<Danger>
Although the installer does not overwrite user information, **always make updated backups of the `C:\AUDICOM` folder** before updating.
</Danger>

### Files to backup

- `\Audicom\AUDIO`: audio files.
- `\Audicom\DB`: music database, contains `user.ini` (users) and `data.sqlite` (Media Asset Management).
- `\Audicom\Log\*.log`: commercial breaks programming.
- `\Audicom\Pgm\*.pgm`: programs and blocks organization. Includes playlists (`.pls`, `.m3u`, `.txt`).
- `\Audicom\Air\*.air`: records of titles broadcast on air.
  <Note>Backup only if the station wants to maintain a complete history. Each .air file takes approximately 80 KB.</Note>
- `\Admicom\`: contains the entire administration database.

<Danger>
Never reinstall the **demo database** or **demonstration programming files**, as this would overwrite the station's actual database.
