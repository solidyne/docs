## About the programming schedule

**Commercial breaks** and **programs** are created separately and stored in different files:

- `.LOG` for commercial breaks.
- `.PGM` for program blocks.

Commercial breaks can be created **manually** with **CyberPlay Editor** (this chapter) or **automatically** with the **ADMICOM Traffic module** (see **ADMICOM** chapter).\
**Program blocks** are defined in **CyberPlay Editor** in different time segments: live programs, **AutoDJ**, pre-built playlists, satellite blocks, etc.

Breaks and blocks are created using **AUDICOM's own instructions**. No need to memorize them: there are **wizards** (e.g., _Magic Programming_) and visual editing tools that streamline scheduling.

### General description

Access the AUDICOM desktop and open **CyberPlay Editor** from the dropdown menu.\
Requires permission in your **user profile** (see **Access Levels**).

AUDICOM builds the schedule from:

- **.LOG** (commercial breaks)
- **.PGM** (music blocks, live, satellite, etc.)

The **commands** for breaks and programs and **filenames** (promos, songs, spots, etc.) are edited in CyberPlay Editor's **LOG** and **PGM** windows.\
Many commands can be managed **graphically** from **CyberPlay-Test** or with wizards like **Magic Programming**.

<Tip>
  Think of the **classic radio grid**: programming by day **00:00 to 24:00**. That's what you'll define in CyberPlay Editor.

### Content scheduling instructions

Below are the **commands** or instructions that generate the different content blocks. Instructions begin with **/ (slash)** unless otherwise noted.\
Each instruction goes on **a single line**.

- The **first block** must **start at 00:00** and the **last end at 24:00**.
- **Upper/lowercase** usage is indistinct.
- If there's a time slot **without a block**, CyberPlay will show a **gray** block with **EMPTY**.

<Warning>
  If the schedule doesn't start at **00:00** or end at **24:00**, the system **won't identify** the day change and programming will be **incorrect**.
</Warning>

The **status window** reports: syntax errors, empty blocks, time overlaps, missing **AutoDJ** formats and other issues.

## LOG and PGM Files – Programming Schedule

Air dates for **breaks (.LOG)** and **programs (.PGM)** can be defined as:

- For a **specific date** (e.g.: 1998-12-25).
- For a **weekday of a month** (e.g.: all **Mondays in April**).
- For a **fixed weekday** (e.g.: **every Monday** of the year).
- For a **month** (e.g.: **August**).
- For an **entire year**.

### PGM/LOG Loading Priority Order

When **CyberPlay** on-air module builds programming, it loads **PGM** and **LOG** in this order:

1. `YYYYMMDD.LOG` / `YYYYMMDD.PGM`\
   Year-Month-Day (e.g.: `20040501`) for **May 1st, 2004**.
2. `WED11.LOG` / `WED11.PGM`\
   All **Wednesdays in November**.
3. `SUN00.LOG` / `SUN00.PGM`\
   **Any Sunday** of the year (`00` means "all").
4. `MONTH04.LOG` / `MONTH04.PGM`\
   **All April**.
5. `MONTH00.LOG` / `MONTH00.PGM`\
   **Every day of the year**.

<Note>
  Abbreviations: **SUN** Sunday, **MON** Monday, **TUE** Tuesday, **WED** Wednesday, **THU** Thursday, **FRI** Friday, **SAT** Saturday, **MONTH** Month.
</Note>

## Programming in the On-Air Manager

The **On-Air** module loads each day the programming for the **next day** using **LOG/PGM** and the previous **priority order**. E.g.: on **08/14/2005** it can load `980814.LOG` (day's breaks) and `MONTH08.PGM` (August program blocks).

**Automatic** loading occurs at **18:00** (configurable in **Configuration Panel**).

If modified:

- **Current day files**
- **Next day files** after automatic reload time

<Warning>
  The programming manager **must notify** the **On-Air operator** to execute a **manual reload** of files (see **Reload** in CyberPlay section).
</Warning>

<Danger>
  Perform **periodic backups** of `C:\Audicom\LOG` and `C:\Audicom\PGM` (default locations).\
  If accidentally deleted, **programming is lost**.
</Danger>
