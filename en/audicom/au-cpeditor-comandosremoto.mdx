## Internet Link - ILink

The `/ILink` command allows AUDICOM to connect to audio streams over the Internet.\
It is used in **repeater stations** that rebroadcast audio streaming and metadata from the master station.

#### Usage example with AUDICOM repeaters

`/Block /00:00-24:00 /ILink="AutoDj Jazz" ilink://190.247.72.170:8080`

In this case, the repeater receives the **streaming** from the head-end.\
During commercial breaks, it replaces the head-end's commercials with **local breaks**.

#### Public Protocol Streaming

`/Block /00:00-24:00 /ILink="AutoDj Jazz" mms://190.247.72.170:8080`

- **MMS Protocol**: Windows standard, requires no additional decoders.
- Other supported protocols:
  - **HTTP Streams**: `icyx://[stream path]` (default port 80).
  - **RTSP Streams**: `rtpx://[stream path]` (default port 554).
  - **HTTP/RTSP Streams**: `htpx://[stream path]` (default port 80).
  - **RTMP Flash Streams**: `rtmx://[stream path]` (default port 1935).

An **AutoDj format** must be specified as backup:\
If the server connection is lost, this format is activated.\
When the link is restored, AutoDj stops and streaming resumes.

## Satellite Fill Block (SatFill)

`/Block /HH:MM-HH:MM /Satfill /X [Block Title]`

In this block, AUDICOM plays the **satellite** signal (or VHF link).\
At specific times it interrupts the external signal to broadcast **local programming** (commercials, music, news, etc.).\
After the break ends, the system returns to **SYNCRO**, resuming the satellite signal until the next break.

#### Switching Methods

- **a) Console remote control**: via USB port.
- **b) Sound card line input**: the system switches the satellite signal to the line input.

The `/X` modifier defines which parallel port output to use:\
`1, 2, 3 or 4` → correspond to Data 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively.\
This allows controlling up to four console modules.

## Master-Slave Satellite Block (SatSlave)

`/Block /HH:MM-HH:MM /Satslave [Block Title]`

**SatSlave** mode automates switching between **local signal** and **satellite signal** using **control pulses** sent by audicom via USB.

- In **SYNC** state, the satellite program module is enabled.
- When a **trigger pulse** arrives from the downlink head-end, AUDICOM switches to **local programming** and executes the corresponding break.
- Upon completion, it returns to the link.

This cycle repeats break after break, synchronizing the local signal with the remote one.

#### Considerations

- If the number of received pulses is **less** than programmed breaks, there will be delay: remaining breaks will trigger at the start of next day.
- If pulses are **greater**, breaks will repeat from the beginning until completing 24h.
- The last SatSlave block requires no pulse: if none arrives, the system switches by schedule to maintain the grid.

#### Example

`/Block /10:00-12:30 /Satslave`

Between 10:00 and 12:30 the satellite signal is transmitted.\
Local breaks, generated by AUDICOM, replace the satellite ones.\
When the block ends, satellite control is deactivated and moves to the next programming segment.
