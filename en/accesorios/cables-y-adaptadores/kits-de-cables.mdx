## Pre-assembled Cable Kits

All consoles have the **optional** purchase of a **generic cable kit**, which varies according to the equipment and model. The available kits for each unit are detailed in the equipment documentation (accessories section).

Users can also request individual cables from the [general catalog](/es/accesorios/cables-y-adaptadores/catalogo). This way they only acquire what is necessary according to their installation configuration. Generic kits contain what is needed for going on air, but each installation has its particularities. No standardized kit guarantees that cables or adapters won't be excess or missing.

## Which cables are factory included?

Some equipment includes part of the cabling from factory, such as USB cables, Ethernet cables, adapters for special outputs (Studio Monitor in Unidex consoles and Classic line) and connectors for On Air Light or GPIO.

In each equipment's documentation, and in the box, you will find details of factory-included cables and connectors.
